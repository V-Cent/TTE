You will have to wait for him to use Overlimit and hit you with Moonlight Assault instead.</p>\n<p>After the tutorial fight, you can change Ludger&#39s weapons, change his skills, and even access the world map right from the start. Interestingly enough, the Spirius Gatekeeper Boss here level scales quite highly, despite being the first boss in the game and would otherwise be unfeasible to reach its level cap in a normal playthrough or NG+</p>\n<p>Afterwards, the story cannot be progressed past the Trigleph Train, as Julius won&#39t be there to trigger the Fractured Dimension.

However, it is possible to do multiple power combos within a single combo, by timing the end of the power hits gauge to line up with a well placed weakness hit. There are multiple ways to go about these weakness resets, which will be explained below.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tox2/knockdown.mp4&#39 }\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tox2/knockdown.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tox2/countercancels.mp4&#39 }\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tox2/countercancels.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p><strong>OTG:</strong> Knock down the boss right as the Power Hits gauge is about to expire, and then OTG them with their weakness. You can also hit them with their weakness while they&#39re downed and then OTG them with a different arte, as bosses can&#39t trigger counters while knocked down. You can also knockdown bosses in the air. Aerial knockdowns do not contribute towards to the KD limit, as long as they are OTG&#39d before touching the ground. In addition, human bosses will attempt to air recover at the earliest possible opportunity, requiring a near instant OTG to retain the combo.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tox2/kd1.mp4&#39 }\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tox2/kd1.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p><strong>Unclean Hits:</strong> If the KD limit has been reached, the boss will gain Iron Stance to prevent you from continuing your combo. You can bypass this by petrifying them, hitting their weakness and then breaking their Iron Stance while they are frozen, in that order. Alternatively, you can also stun them with an arte that OTGs, such as Stun Blitz or backwards Hammer Flail, or use an arte with the Iron Stance Break property after hitting a weakness while they&#39re downed.</p>\n<p><strong>Counter Cancel (Launch):</strong> Wait for gauge to run out and hit the enemy with an attack that both launches upwards and hits a weakness. This will trigger a counter and depending on the boss will be RNG dependant. The counter will be rolled from their ground-counter pool and for this to work they have to use an attack that can only be used on the ground. After the super armor wears off hit with another element to resume comboing normally.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tox2/launch.mp4&#39 }\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tox2/launch.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p><strong>Counter Cancel (Landing):</strong> Essentially the opposite of the launch method. Have the enemy airborne as the gauge is about to run out, then hit with anything that doesn&#39t juggle or give the enemy more air time AND hit a weakness. This relies on the air-counter pool to roll with an attack that can only be used in the air and get cancelled as they land before they can use it. After the super armor wears off hit with another element to resume comboing normally.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tox2/landing.mp4&#39 }\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tox2/landing.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p>Outside of the obvious utility of combo extension and DPS, weakness resets can also be used to limit your own damage or element usage, without sacrificing combo length. As a practical example, some Elite Monsters will \"break\" after hitting them with too many elements in a Power Combo. By using weakness resets to let Power Hits end at a low multiplier, and then continue a fresh Power Hits chain from scratch, you can keep your combos going freely.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"no-weakness-juggling\" data-open=\"no-weakness-juggling general-techniques combat-techniques\">No Weakness Juggling</h4><div class=\"no-weakness-juggling\">\n<p>For bosses that have no air counter, it is possible to juggle them in the air without the use of power combos. This is particularly useful for some bosses that have no weaknesses such as Chronos 1 and Victor (Hammer or Guns only). To do this, you must bait out their Overlimit first by launching them and attacking them while they&#39re airborne. Without an air counter, they will be forced to use their Overlimit instead to escape. After their Overlimit runs out, they will have no means of escape for 60 seconds until it recharges. As long as the boss isn&#39t standing on the ground, you can juggle them freely during this time. Be aware that the boss can still recover from an aerial knockdown, but as long as they don&#39t land, you can still keep the combo going.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"linked-arte-cancel\" data-open=\"linked-arte-cancel general-techniques combat-techniques\">Linked Arte Cancel</h4><div class=\"linked-arte-cancel\">\n<p>Similar to Fatal Strikes from Vesperia, you can cancel the animation of any arte with a Linked Arte as long as the glyph is active (LAC). For example, you can use Demon Fist as Jude, then use Dragon Shot, and cancel Dragon Shot by using the Linked Arte from Demon Fist. If the character is airborne, this will cause them to fall to the ground similarly to the Quick Drop skill.</p>\n<p>For Linked artes that are spells (such as Rock Hexad), you can spell cancel them by guarding, just as you would a normal spell. Using this in tandem with LAC can allow you to cancel an arte at virtually any point and continue as normal. If your character has the Casting Window skill, you can also have the Linked Arte glyph come out before the intiial spell comes out.</p>\n<p>In both cases of LAC, artes with lingering hitboxes benefit greatly from this tech. Such artes include traps (such as Mine Collapse or Sun Spark), artes that have a delayed reaction (such as Light of Ruin and Squall Shot), and spells such as Flame Ring.</p>\n</div></div></div><hr class=\"content__h3--divider\" draggable=\"false\"></div><div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"miscellaneous-techniques combat-techniques\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"miscellaneous-techniques\">Miscellaneous Techniques</h3><div class=\"miscellaneous-techniques\">\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"elemental-shift\" data-open=\"elemental-shift miscellaneous-techniques combat-techniques\">Elemental Shift</h4><div class=\"elemental-shift\">\n<p>When you use a non-elemental multi-hit arte, or a projectile such as Demon Fang or Pulse Shot, you can change the element of the arte while it&#39s already out by opening the menu and changing your weapons to an different element. The color of the arte won&#39t change, but it will take on the attributes of the newly equipped weapon. This is handy for hitting a specific weakness in a pinch or to land a status ailment without being completely tied to its respective element.</p>\n<p>For Ludger specifically, his weapon swap mechanic serves the same purpose and can be used to alter the elements of (Double) Demon Fang and Pow Hammer without the use of a menu.</p>\n</div></div></div></div>"},{"id":"character-specific-arte-info","name":"Character Specific Arte Info","color":"green","content":"\n<div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"ludger character-specific-arte-info\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"ludger\">Ludger</h3><div class=\"ludger\">\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"falling-snow\" data-open=\"falling-snow ludger character-specific-arte-info\">Falling Snow</h4><div class=\"falling-snow\">\n<p>One of the most flexible Artes on a character famous for his versatility, Falling Snow (abbreviated as FS) is a staple of Ludger&#39s kit and can find immediate value in just about any aspect of his gameplay. To start with a short summary of FS&#39s positives, it has:</p>\n<p>-Near instant startup</p>\n<p>-Travels about a third of the screen in about half a second</p>\n<p>-Long hitstun; long enough to AC reset from for free</p>\n<p>-Air OK</p>\n<p>-OTG</p>\n<p>FS is a single hit, non-elemental slash arte, which makes it very valuable as a combo starter and general combo tool for its speed and distance. It also serves as a cornerstone of combo resets thanks to its OTG property and it pairing really nicely with elemental weapons.</p>\n<p>If Ludger goes through an enemy with FS, he will turn around at the end of the arte to face them. If FS collides with an enemy from max distance, Ludger will end the arte face first in front of the enemy. He won&#39t turn around and the recovery frames are greatly reduced.</p>\n<p>As a mobility tool, FS is invaluable for the amount of space it covers for how fast it is, and how it can singlehandedly invalidate some artes such as Tetra Spell by speeding past all the hitboxes. FS doesn&#39t actually have invul frames though, so be mindful of that when using it to evade artes that hit a wide range or are also just as fast, like Gnome II.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that despite this arte having a lot of positives, it does have one minor, but not insignificant flaw. If you swap to Hammer or Guns right after FS, your hurtbox will extend to the distance you travelled, which can leave you vulnerable if you plan to use this Arte as an evasion tool. This glitch can be sidestepped by, well, sidestepping (or any other action) between using FS and the weapon swap.</p>\n<p><strong>Reverse Falling Snow (RFS)</strong> is an extension to FS that will come out by holding FS&#39s arte shortcut and having the arte connect. RFS has different trajectories depending on if it is used on the ground or in the air.</p>\n<p>Ground RFS has Ludger doing a second FS in the opposite direction of the first, which ends with him back turned to the foe instead of facing them. This is particularly useful for setting up backwards hitbox-based combos, or positioning for traps. Ground FS also causes human enemies and smaller to spin, which can be problematic for aforementioned hitbox abuse, depending on what you&#39re fighting.</p>\n<p>Air RFS has Ludger doing his second FS in a 45 degree angle upwards, reminiscent of Air Divide from Vesperia. Air RFS comes out faster than ground RFS and also lifts the enemy slightly in place. This variant is specialized for air juggles and the lifting effect pairs up nicely with artes like Migrating Sparrows, as well as Quick Drop to keep the enemy airborne for as long as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Chromatus Falling Snow (CFS)</strong> is effectively a different arte than the rest, as it lacks a lot of the general utility that FS normally has, due to how CS mechanics work. But it shares enough properties and is one of CS&#39s strongest artes, so its still worth discussing.</p>\n<p>CFS is ground only, and will autocorrect you to face the enemy <em>before</em> the arte comes out, so it is more limited in a positioning sense. However it makes up for that by not only retaining its usual OTG property, but also comes with the rare <em>Iron Stance Break</em> property. This allows CS to break the OTG limit by bypassing the Iron Stance bosses obtain upon hitting the limit.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"traps\" data-open=\"traps ludger character-specific-arte-info\">Traps</h4><div class=\"traps\">\n<p>(Mine Collapse/Bubble Blast/Meteoric Waltz)</p>\n<p>[TODO]</p>\n</div></div></div><hr class=\"content__h3--divider\" draggable=\"false\"></div><div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"milla character-specific-arte-info\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"milla\">Milla</h3><div class=\"milla\">\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"aerial-spell-glitch\" data-open=\"aerial-spell-glitch milla character-specific-arte-info\">Aerial Spell Glitch</h4><div class=\"aerial-spell-glitch\">\n<p>Normally, equipping the Aerial Spell skill disables Milla&#39s ability to Spirit Shift her artes in the air. However, it is possible to use Aerial Spell without having the skill equipped, enabling Milla to use both versions of her artes in the air and greatly increasing her flexibility.</p>\n<p>Use an arte while in the air and then input the spell you want to use while the current arte is being performed. Right as the spell is about to come out, either set Milla to Auto Mode or switch to another character. The timing is tight, but if done correctly Milla should transition into the spell instead of its shifted version.</p>\n<p>Despite Elize and Muzét having access to Aerial Spell in Xillia 2, this tech is exclusive to Milla as it is a glitch involving the Spirit Shift mechanic.</p>\n</div></div></div></div>"},{"id":"references","name":"References","color":"red","content":"\n<p>Special thanks to users <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/UnlimitedMrX/featured\">Jakkun</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SamucHedgehog\">Samu</a>.</p>\n"}]'id=tales-of-xillia-2>Tales of Xillia 2</h1><p><a href=https://aselia.fandom.com/wiki/Tales_of_Xillia_2>Tales of Xillia 2</a> (テイルズ オブ エクシリア ２ Teiruzu obu Ekushiria Tsu) was released in Japan on November 1, 2012 for the PS3 (later releasing on North America and Europe).<div id=content__selector><div id=content__selectorbox><div class=content__selectorbox--item data-highlight=#f8d959 data-open=base-mechanics style=--highlight-color:#f8d959>Base Mechanics</div><div class=content__selectorbox--item data-highlight=#fe796f data-open=glitches style=--highlight-color:#fe796f>Glitches</div><div class=content__selectorbox--item data-highlight=#45c9c9 data-open=combat-techniques style=--highlight-color:#45c9c9>Combat Techniques</div><div class=content__selectorbox--item data-highlight=#58f15b data-open=character-specific-arte-info style=--highlight-color:#58f15b>Character Specific Arte Info</div><div class=content__selectorbox--item data-highlight=#e74a41 data-open=references style=--highlight-color:#e74a41>References</div></div><hr id=content__selectorhr><div id=content__mobilechevrons><span class="content__mobilechevrons--left material-symbols-rounded">chevron_backward</span><span class="content__mobilechevrons--right material-symbols-rounded">chevron_forward</span></div></div><div id=content__currenth2></div>
