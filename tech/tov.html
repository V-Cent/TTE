The player can link normal attacks into artes to prolong the combo chain. A normal arte can be followed by either an altered arte or an arcane arte. An altered arte can be followed by an arcane arte. Arcanes cannot be followed by other artes. Also, normal attacks can be followed by a free-run attack (Free-run + normal attack). This results into a chain progression like this:</p>\n<p>Normal Attack (x3) → Free-run Attack → Base Arte → Altered Arte → Arcane Arte</p>\n<p>Other skills in the game can change the number of normal attacks and artes you can use before your normal progression ends. There are also skills that can change the limitations on altered and arcane artes, making them be followed by any other arte.</p>\n<p>One important thing to note is that, if you are able to do two artes of the same tier in succession, you cannot use the same one without a different arte in between(e.g. Azure Edge into Azure Edge).</p>\n<p>Fatal Strikes (<strong>FS</strong>), when unlocked, can also be used by pressing the FS button (default as right trigger) when the FS symbol appears on screen after an arte. Pressing the button too early or too late will cause the current FS symbol disappear, making you to do another arte to try again.</p>\n<p>FS, Burst Artes and Overlimit can be performed in any part of the chain when applicable.</p>\n</div><hr class=\"content__h3--divider\" draggable=\"false\"></div><div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"overlimit-and-burst-artes base-mechanics\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"overlimit-and-burst-artes\">Overlimit and Burst Artes</h3><div class=\"overlimit-and-burst-artes\">\n<p>Overlimit is a mechanic where you can consume the overlimit bar for special effects. The most import effect is that you do not have any limitations on your arte progression, being able to chain normals and any artes in a free-form way. During overlimit you can also use Burst Artes by holding the artes button after an altered or arcane arte. The Burst Arte you use depends on certain skills your character has enabled.</p>\n<p>Overlimit has special effects depending on the level of overlimit used (higher levels also have the effects of lower ones):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lv.1: No special effects.</li>\n<li>Lv.2: All attacks restand and deal increased damage to downed enemies.</li>\n<li>Lv.3: No TP is consumed for using artes. Mystic artes are enabled for use by holding the normal attack button after an arcane arte or burst arte.</li>\n<li>Lv.4: Characters will be invincible from enemies attack. Be careful since you (and enemies) can still be stunned!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind that some of your opponents can also have Overlimit! They gain it throughout the fight based on the same rules of the player, and, depending on the enemy, you can even hear the sound effect for each individual OVL bar the enemy gains.</p>\n<p><strong>OVL activation hit effects</strong></p>\n<p>The overlimit activation hit also has different effects depending on the character you are using. These usually influence the vertical launch power or the pushback of the overlimit hit. The effects are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Yuri</strong>: Very small launch and small pushback. Enemy is knocked down.</li>\n<li><strong>Estelle</strong>: Medium launch and small pushback. Enemy is put in a spinning state for 70 frames. OTGs (doesn&#39t cause the spinning state if enemy is down, stagger time does not change).</li>\n<li><strong>Repede</strong>: No launch and no pushback. Enemy is put in a spinning state for 90 frames. OTGs (doesn&#39t cause the spinning state if enemy is down, stagger time does not change).</li>\n<li><strong>Karol</strong>: No launch and very small pushback. Enemy is knocked down.</li>\n<li><strong>Rita</strong>: Medium launch and small pushback. Enemy is knocked down.</li>\n<li><strong>Raven</strong>: No launch and medium pushback. Does not knockdown the enemy (staggers for about 60 frames). OTGs.</li>\n<li><strong>Judith</strong>: Very high launch and medium pushback. Enemy is knocked down.</li>\n<li><strong>Patty</strong>: Depends on Patty&#39s current form.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Normal Form: High launch and medium pushback. Enemy is knocked down.</li>\n<li>Advance Form: Small launch and small pushback. Enemy is knocked down.</li>\n<li>Brainiac Form: No launch and very high pushback. Enemy is knocked down.</li>\n<li>Critical Form: Medium launch and small pushback. Enemy is put in a spinning state for 90 frames. OTGs (doesn&#39t cause the spinning state if enemy is down, stagger time does not change).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flynn</strong>: Medium launch and medium pushback. Enemy is knocked down.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Multiple activations (either by yourself or with CPUs/other players) will cause effects to stack or interact with one another. This may result in a very high vertical launch or knockdown. Make sure to be ready to attack downed enemies when specific characters use overlimit. When using Yuri, remember you can chain the OVL activation hit with a free-run attack, picking the enemy up and making follow up attacks easier.</p>\n</div><hr class=\"content__h3--divider\" draggable=\"false\"></div><div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"other-information base-mechanics\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"other-information\">Other information</h3><div class=\"other-information\">\n<p><strong>Staggered States and Down Mechanics</strong>\nEnemies have 3 different states they can be in while staggered.</p>\n<p><em>Standing</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The enemy is staggered but still standing. They can be hit by any attack. From here, they can transition to two other states: ground-down and aerial-down.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Ground-Down</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the normal grounded state, which starts when the enemy touches the ground.</li>\n<li>Attacks that have a \"grounded\" tag can hit an enemy that is down. Some grounded attacks can also <em>restand</em>, which will instantly put the staggered enemy back on its feet. If the attack does not restand, it will either cause another ground-down or an aerial-down.\n-The enemy will start an animation to get up after a certain period.  During the initial frames of this animation, the enemy can be hit by all attacks. This is called a <strong>down hit</strong>. This only lasts for a few frames. After that, the enemy becomes invulnerable as it gets up.</li>\n<li>You can also perform <strong>down hits</strong> at any moment if the enemy is stunned. This only works once per stun, since if you hit them the stun will disappear.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Aerial-Down</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is an aerial state for when the enemy is down in the air. The animation that plays during this state is different from the ground-down animation.</li>\n<li>While in the air, the enemy can be hit by most attacks. This allows you to juggle the enemy by using artes that launch the enemy up.</li>\n<li>Once the enemy touches the ground, they will bounce and transition to the ground-down state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Definitions:\nGrounded attacks: Attacks that can hit during any part of a ground-down.\nRestands: Attacks that put the staggered enemy back to the standing state. Restands work independently from grounded attacks (e.g., the second hit of Shining Dragon Swarm restands, but the attack is not tagged as grounded and thus you need to time a <em>down hit</em>).\nDown Hit: When you attack an enemy just before it starts getting up or if they&#39re down and stunned.</p>\n<p><strong>Ground-Down Limit</strong>\nStaggered enemies have a hard limit of 10 ground-downs. Overlimit activations that cause a ground-down do not count towards this counter. Once you hit the limit, you can no longer perform down hits. Attacks that have the \"grounded\" flag will still work. An exception is that, once you hit the limit, you can still perform down hits during your current attack chain. Ending the chain (e.g., by performing a manual cancel or returning to neutral) will prevent further down hits.</p>\n<p>Notes:\nIf the boss performs the \"Recover\" skill, they will still maintain the ground-down counter. Additionally, bosses can only recover or do techouts/revenge attacks during or just after an aerial-down. Once in the ground-down state, ground hits or attacks that only cause a ground-down will not cause a recover or techout/revenge.\nSome bosses or enemies may not have an aerial-down state. If the enemy is standing, aerial-down attacks will instead instantly transition to the ground-down state; if not, the enemy will not react, but the stagger time will increase like normal. After the enemy is knocked down, further aerial-downs will also disable techouts/revenges and the use of recover.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Casting Time Mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>Spells need casting time before they can come out. There are ways however, to reduce this time. They are:</p>\n<p>Accessories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mystic Mark: 15% reduction.</li>\n<li>Mystic Symbol: 25% reduction.</li>\n<li>Shizel&#39s Necklace: 50% reduction (Rita only).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed Spell: 30% reduction.</li>\n<li>Light Magic: 40% reduction.</li>\n<li>Rhythm: Up to 50%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chains:</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39todo&#39 : true}\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\" style=\"color: goldenrod; margin-right: 15px; cursor: help;\" data-tte-todo-trigger=\"\" data-tte-tooltip-text=\"This section needs work, is not confirmed or needs testing.\">error</span></span></p>\n<p>All these reduction only affect artes will only work up to certain amount, just like other games in the series.</p>\n<p>With Rita, being in the air automatically cancels the special animation of advanced spells. Spell casting is also faster overall by about 18 frames (not counting the time saved by the animation of advanced spells).</p>\n</div></div>"},{"id":"glitches","name":"Glitches","color":"pink","content":"\n<p>In this section, we have a group of glitches and a small description on how to replicate/explain them.

Pausing and un-pausing can also improve consistency when using two controllers alone (and does not make the camera move around).</p>\n<p>The second is to have Raven in the party. During the action you want to cancel, pause and change to Raven. While in the menu, use your personal strategy (character specific down strategy), pause and un-pause, change back to your character and change to the strategy back to the one you want to use. This is more consistent than using Repede to taunt yourself, since you would have wait a couple of frames to make sure the taunt will come out.</p>\n<p>If you want to avoid the camera change caused by Raven&#39s personal strategy, you can use a similar method with two controllers: set your player 1 as Raven and have hit sit on auto-mode. Use player 2 to attack until you want the cancel to happen, where you would pause, set your character&#39s personal strategy, and un-pause. In the menu, the strategy would show as player&#39s 2 character (the one that paused the game), but Raven&#39s is the one that will be activated. For better control, unequip Taunt from Repede and only equip a taunt weapon once you enter the menu. You can then unequip the weapon once you don&#39t need the cancel properties of the taunt.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><span class=\"tagging tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tov/fakeGuardArte.mp4&#39 }\"><h4 id=\"empty-guard-artes\" data-open=\"empty-guard-artes general-techniques techniques\">Empty Guard Artes</h4> </span><div class=\"empty-guard-artes\"><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tov/fakeGuardArte.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p>\n<p>Skills needed: Guard artes.</p>\n<p>In semi-auto mode, guarding then doing a base arte from a distance makes you run to the enemy, however the invincibility effect happens as soon as you begin to run.

For bosses, fatal strikes deal a large amount of damage. To decrease the gauge, you can use artes or normal attacks that correspond to specific color or direction.</p>\n<p>FS also gives bonus during and at the end of battle. At the end of battle you can be awarded with extra EXP, LP or Drop Rate. This bonus will be higher depending on your FS chain, which is the amount of FS glyphs that appeared before you performed the FS. This is limited to the same combo. For example, a chain of 10 is enough for any drop to have 100% chance of happening. The specific award that you get depends on the type of enemy that you performed the FS chain against.</p>\n<p>The FS bonuses during battle depend on the chain before you activated them. A Green FS will recover TP. A Red FS will buff defensive stats. A Blue FS will buff offensive stats. This bonus will increase by 1% for each FS chain you do (thus, the bonus will be the same as the current chain number you have on screen). This is limited to 25% on the Definitive or PS3 version. On the Vanilla Xbox version this number is unlimited. One important thing to note, however, is that this buff is depend on the last glyph your target had, which may not be the glyph you started the FS activation on.</p>\n<p>On the Definitive version, FS glyphs stay on screen for less time than both the Vanilla version and the PS3 version. This effect happens on all platforms and with different frame rates.</p>\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"false-strikes\" data-open=\"false-strikes fatal-strike-techniques techniques\">False Strikes</h4><div class=\"false-strikes\">\n<p>It is possible to make Fatal Strikes not instantly kill enemies by pressing the Fatal Strike button one frame before the Fatal Strike late fail state and one frame after it. This will cause both the FS success and fail animation to play at the same time. Doing this on a boss makes so that the FS gauge does not recover and that no bonuses for FS are applied (for the current FS); the same effects also happen on normal enemies.</p>\n<p>To make it easier to perform, it is possible to use pause buffering to get the correct frames more consistently. Once you get the frame, simply un-pause and then quickly press FS + menu again. Repeat the same steps to hit the second frame needed for the technique. While this setup is still inconsistent, it makes it way easier to perform. Using specific artes to trigger the FS glyph can also improve consistency.</p>\n<p>This is possible in all versions in the game and with various frame rates (60, 75, uncapped...).</p>\n<p>More information <a href=\"https://muragiri.hatenadiary.org/entry/20100322/p1\">here</a>.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"target-change-fatal-strike\" data-open=\"target-change-fatal-strike fatal-strike-techniques techniques\">Target Change Fatal Strike</h4><div class=\"target-change-fatal-strike\">\n<p>There is another way to not instantly kill enemies when using a Fatal Strike. To perform this trick, simply activate a Fatal Strike and pressing the menu button at the same time; when on the menu, change your character to auto-mode and use an arte on another monster on the field that wasn&#39t the one you performed the FS on. Your character will change targets but still perform the FS (which will not kill the enemy). If the FS hits the enemy that had the FS glyph, it will still not kill it (as long as your character was not aiming for them).</p>\n<p>You can use other party members to setup a FS on a monster you are not attacking, making it possible for you to use the FS on a monster that still has their FS gauge full or using Fatal Strikes mid combo.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that an arte will be buffered if you do this. You also need to change the character you were controlling back to semi-auto or manual.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"fatal-strike-cancel\" data-open=\"fatal-strike-cancel fatal-strike-techniques techniques\">Fatal Strike Cancel</h4><div class=\"fatal-strike-cancel\">\n<p>While the enemy has a Fatal Strike glyph up, you can press an action and the FS button together to cancel your <em>current action</em> (if possible) and instantly start the action you pressed (the <em>cancel action</em>). This can only be performed when you are able to perform a successful FS in the first place, so keep in mind that some actions disable your FS use momentarily. In most cases, FS use is enabled after the last hit of most artes (but earlier than it can be canceled normally).</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tov/fscancel.mp4&#39 }\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tov/fscancel.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p><em>Cancel actions</em> can be artes or normal attacks.</p>\n<p>There a few important notes about this cancel:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your arte chain rules persist when using FS Cancelling, thus, you cannot use an arte that wouldn&#39t be able to be chained without the cancel in place. This means that, for most characters, you cannot FS cancel an Arcane arte when not in OVL.</li>\n<li>If your character is in the air, you are only able to use air-enabled artes when doing the cancel.</li>\n<li>Just like the Taunt Cancel, your momentum will persist depending on your previous action, as you can see <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/sailorvick/clip/HonestBetterSaladSMOrc\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div><hr class=\"content__h3--divider\" draggable=\"false\"></div><div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"manual-cancel techniques\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"manual-cancel\">Manual Cancel</h3><div class=\"manual-cancel\">\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tov/manualCancel.mp4&#39 }\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tov/manualCancel.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p>For the Repede skill, it enables the user to use Manual Cancel in any direction (360 degrees) and also use it in semi-auto mode.</p>\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"manual-cancel-basics\" data-open=\"manual-cancel-basics manual-cancel techniques\">Manual Cancel Basics</h4><div class=\"manual-cancel-basics\">\n<p>After an arte you can free run to the direction of the arte to start a free-run as soon as you can cancel the arte.

Without manipulating them, they can apparently drop out of your combo and punish you, even while they the stagger values would not allow them too. To combat that, here are some techniques that can help you combo bosses:</p>\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><span class=\"tagging tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39todo&#39 : true }\"><h4 id=\"recovery-attack-baiting\" data-open=\"recovery-attack-baiting boss-behavior-manipulation techniques\">Recovery Attack baiting</h4> <span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\" style=\"color: goldenrod; margin-right: 15px; cursor: help;\" data-tte-todo-trigger=\"\" data-tte-tooltip-text=\"This section needs work, is not confirmed or needs testing.\">error</span></span><div class=\"recovery-attack-baiting\">\n<p>Letting the enemy do their chain before you start your combo (punishing the enemy at the end of their combo) or punishing their recovery attacks in a safely manner (e.g. using knockdowns mid-combo and expecting them to use an arte) can make so that you can perform your combos \"mostly\" uninterrupted.</p>\n<p>The number of attacks a boss can use is unique to each boss (though they are usually the same as the player).</p>\n<p>For example, punishing a normal -&ampgt; base -&ampgt; arcane chain as you start your combo will more than likely work for most bosses. Punishing 2-3 of their recovery attacks during the combo will also work the same way.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"stun-lock\" data-open=\"stun-lock boss-behavior-manipulation techniques\">Stun lock</h4><div class=\"stun-lock\">\n<p>Stunning an enemy during a combo will make so that they will not be able to do a recovery attack during it. If you did not bait recovery attacks previously (in the same combo), keep in mind that the enemy may still do them if knocked down.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"boss-documented-behavior\" data-open=\"boss-documented-behavior boss-behavior-manipulation techniques\">Boss Documented Behavior</h4><div class=\"boss-documented-behavior\">\n<p>There are certain behavior that are unique to bosses also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recover Breakout: Knocking a boss down may make the boss do a flip (recover) and stay on the standing state, instead of being knocked down.</li>\n<li>Stat Breakout: Due to defenses, a boss may be able to solid stance through your attacks (even after you break their guard). This effect is not that common, and only certain bosses may have enough defenses to solid stance through your initial attacks.</li>\n<li>Recovery Attack Breakout: If able, the boss can do a recovery attack mid-combo. This also resets the staggered status (but does not drop your current combo chain), so a stat breakout may occur if you hit them in frames that they are not vulnerable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, to properly combo a boss without ever being punished you need: good offensive stats to not trigger solid stance during the combo, baiting recovery attacks or an arte chain and, finally, a stun lock.</p>\n<p>More information can be found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKdSnZqTX5w\">here</a>.</p>\n</div></div></div><hr class=\"content__h3--divider\" draggable=\"false\"></div><div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"semi-auto-cancel techniques\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"semi-auto-cancel\">Semi-auto Cancel</h3><div class=\"semi-auto-cancel\">\n<p>Also sometimes called Stick Cancel, the Semi-auto cancel (SAC) is a technique that abuses the free-run animation that happens when you use semi-auto, and the buffered actions of auto mode.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tov/sac.mp4&#39 }\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tov/sac.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p>SAC can be set-up mid combo, and it does not require neutral stance/guard to be in effect.</p>\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"semi-auto-cancel-basics\" data-open=\"semi-auto-cancel-basics semi-auto-cancel techniques\">Semi-auto Cancel Basics</h4><div class=\"semi-auto-cancel-basics\">\n<p>While in any action (free-run, guard, jump or arte) go to the menu and buffer an arte by selecting it while in auto mode (in the character that you&#39re controlling), then, while in battle, change back to semi-auto mode (manual can be used in limited scenarios). The arte you selected in auto mode is now buffered and the game will make you run to the enemy to use it every time it is possible.</p>\n<p>While this arte is buffered, you can, while in a combo, perform another arte that requires you to run to the target (due to the semi-auto mechanics) to instantly cancel you to neutral and start the buffered arte (thus starting another semi-auto run). If you perform another action before the buffered action is completed, you successfully used a Semi-auto cancel to reset your arte progression and use an action when your not supposed to.</p>\n<p>For example, with Yuri:</p>\n<p>Set auto buffered arte as Draconian Slash.</p>\n<p>Free-run to the enemy and do Azure Storm. Cancel Azure Storm into Severing Fang. This will start the free-run animation, and instantly cancel it into another free-run animation that will perform Draconian Slash if you let it. Instead of that, do another Azure Storm just after inputting Severing Fang. This will cause Yuri to do Azure Storm followed to Azure Storm, something that is not possibly normally.</p>\n<p>For all further examples, artes set on auto (in this example Draconian Slash) are called <strong>buffered artes</strong>. Artes used for the cancel are called (in this example Severing Fang) are called <strong>cancel artes</strong>.</p>\n<p>For better effect, both buffered artes and cancel artes need to be artes that require your character to be very close to the enemy to perform. The enemy dimensions can also be important, since there are occasions where the character will be stuck in the free-run animation without the arte coming out (usually on the enemy&#39s tails or limbs).</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you can also cancel to normals instead of artes.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"spell-sac\" data-open=\"spell-sac semi-auto-cancel techniques\">Spell SAC</h4><div class=\"spell-sac\">\n<p>If you use a spell as the cancel arte, the SAC instantly cancels it, allowing you to chain any arte as fast as possible with no distance restriction. This helps in occasions where the cancel arte can come one by mistake due to the distance between you and the enemy.</p>\n<p>This variation can also be done on manual monde.</p>\n<p>In semi-auto, if you mash spells while moving they will be instantly cancelled into movement again, resulting in some interesting visual effects.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"walk-sac\" data-open=\"walk-sac semi-auto-cancel techniques\">Walk SAC</h4><div class=\"walk-sac\">\n<p>If you use the left-stick as the main form of movement, and hold the walk angle (slight movement on the L-Stick), any movement due to the semi-auto run will be a walk instead, increasing the consistency of the technique.</p>\n<p>You can also hold the walk angle away from the enemy, causing the user to do a quick turn around, giving you even more time to perform the cancel.</p>\n<p>Finally, you can always cancel the semi-auto run into a free-run, preventing any sort of arte to come out and easily chaining into your own arte or free-run attack.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"sac-consume\" data-open=\"sac-consume semi-auto-cancel techniques\">SAC consume</h4><div class=\"sac-consume\">\n<p>An even easier way to perform SAC&#39s is to set the buffered arte as the arte you want to use instead. This way, the cancel arte is the only one which requires the distance to be strict. The objective is to do your combo, use your cancel arte and then do nothing and wait for the buffered arte to come out.</p>\n<p>If you want, you can then pause and set up a new buffered arte to use another SAC consume, mid-combo.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><span class=\"tagging tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tov/pushGuardChain.mp4&#39 }\"><h4 id=\"push-guard-chain\" data-open=\"push-guard-chain semi-auto-cancel techniques\">Push Guard Chain</h4> </span><div class=\"push-guard-chain\"><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tov/pushGuardChain.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p>\n<p>Skills needed: Guard artes, Critical Guard.</p>\n<p>If your cancel arte is a base arte, you can use it to cancel push guards (Critical Guard skill), making it possible to chain them until your close enough to perform your buffered arte.

Using a magic guard (with the cancel base arte set as down) can make you perform the chains even faster, making you invincible for multiple seconds and even minutes.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{ &#39media&#39 : &#39media/tov/fakeGuardArteChaining.mp4&#39 }\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/tov/fakeGuardArteChaining.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n</div></div></div></div>"},{"id":"references","name":"References","color":"green","content":"\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKdSnZqTX5w\nhttps://muragiri.hatenadiary.org/archive/category/%E3%82%82%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8%E6%A5%BD%E3%81%97%E3%82%80%20TOV\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAFJ4Ho-Qts\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/sailorvick/clip/HonestBetterSaladSMOrc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZizRvRh3Oo&ampamp;t=44s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWfSeT08yUs</p>\n"}]'id=tales-of-vesperia>Tales of Vesperia</h1><p><a href=https://aselia.fandom.com/wiki/Tales_of_Vesperia>Tales of Vesperia</a> (テイルズ オブ ヴェスペリア Teiruzu obu Vesuperia) was originally released in Japan on August 7, 2008 for the Xbox 360 (later releasing on North America and Europe).
