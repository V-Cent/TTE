# How to Contribute

Thank you for taking interesting in contributing to TTE!

If you wish to contribute on the page of a game, being adding **new techniques**, clarifying old ones, **fixing errors** and the sort, you may only need a github account. For those, we use markdown, which is a simple text format that is used in multiple projects (like when you type in Discord!). If you need some guidance on how to work with markdown files, you can check our styling guide which can be found on the bottom of every page. The only strict rule we adhere is making sure the content of markdown page is fairly original or is given the sources and credits when necessary. If you're not the original author of a guide or a segment of text, make sure to ask for permission first and then add credits in the document.

If you wish to contribute with the functionality of the page, you may have noticed â€” this is a "simple" javascript/css/html project. This was was done for one reason: community maintainability. While pure javascript projects are not exactly the easiest to maintain (and the build system makes our project very messy), it is the easiest to learn (and you usually learn it first in webdev classes). Due to Tales of games not being exactly mainstream, and the tech/challenge running/speedrunning communities being even more niche, this was chosen currently as the best approach to keep the project alive (or in hibernation). This, however, is open to change. If you're an experienced Front-End developer and wish to contribute on this, feel free to reach out with your ideas on the Github discussions page! The project's aim is to have a light, fast and modern static website where each document is created in a human-readable language, enabling those that do not know any web technologies to contribute easily.

## Tech

For tech pages, our objective is readability and well-defined explanations. Because of that, modifications on tech pages can be done both for adding new information or modifying the current page to improve a segment and fix any grammar mistakes.

To do that, you can use our Github Discussions tab (explained below) or start a Pull Request.

The flow to start a Pull Request is first to fork the project. To do that, you can simply check to the top right corner of the TTE project page. This fork is where you can do changes that only affect your version of TTE.

You can either clone that fork using git or edit the pages using GitHub itself (something that can be easy since the tech pages are made using the markdown format). After you did your changes, you can commit it to your fork and then proceed to a pull request.

To start a pull request, you can go to the Pull Requests page for the TTE project and start comparing your version to the current main branch of TTE. Fill the template that is on screen and you're done! A team member will review your changes, request modifications if needed and merge it with TTE.

### Github Discussions

One of the objectives of TTE is working on techniques that have been already found, but lack a consistent way to perform. For that, we may have segments in tech segments with a TODO tag or we may use GitHub Discussions to track progress on each technique.

If you know about a technique but you're still not sure how it works, you can contribute by updating the Github Discussions page of that game. You can also use that page if you know a technique but don't know how to create a Pull Request or simply don't wish to. A team member will add the technique to the page and credit you by linking the GitHub Discussion link.

To use Github Discussions, you need to log in on your GitHub account and go to the "Github Discussions" tab of the TTE project (not the home page of the app).

### Media

One important thing that you may question when making changes is how to handle media.

TODO.

## Enhancements, Bug Fixes and Other

For all other modifications, you can also follow the same tips as above -- use github discussions, create an issue, or create a pull request with your changes.
