# How to Contribute

Thank you for taking interesting in contributing to TTE! The format of this project is quite simple and made for ease-of-use, thus you can contribute even without knowing markdown or web technologies (html, css, javascript).

The only strict rule we adhere is making sure the content of markdown page is fairly original or is given the sources and credits when necessary. If you're not the original author of a guide or a segment of text, make sure to ask for permission first and then add credits in the document.

If you need some guidance on how to work with markdown files, you can check our styling guide which can be found on the bottom of every page.

## Table of Contents

## Discussions

One of the objectives of TTE is working on techniques that have been already found, but lack a consistent way to perform. For that, we may have segments in tech segments with a TODO tag or we may use GitHub issues to track progress on each technique.

### Issues

If you know about a technique but you're still not sure how it works, you can create a GitHub issue to start a discussion on that topic. You can also create a GitHub issue if you know a technique but don't know how to use Git to create a new addition (by doing a Pull Request) or simply don't wish to. A team member will add the technique to the page and credit you by linking the GitHub issue number.

To create a GitHub issue, you need to log in on your GitHub account and go to the Issues page of the TTE project (not the home page of the app). There, you can start an issue based on different templates.

## Tech

For tech pages, our objective is readability and well-defined explanations. Because of that, modifications on tech pages can be done both for adding new information or modifying the current page to improve a segment and fix any grammar mistakes.

To do that, you can either create an issue as explained above, or make the changes yourself and start a pull request.

The flow to start a Pull Request is first to fork the project. To do that, you can simply go to the top right corner of the TTE project page. This fork is where you can do changes that only affect your version of TTE.

You can either clone that fork using git or edit the pages using GitHub itself (something that can be easy since the tech pages are made using the markdown format). After you did your changes, you can commit it to your fork and then proceed to a pull request.

To start a pull request, you can go to the Pull Requests page for the TTE project and start comparing your version to the current main branch of TTE. Fill the template that is on screen and you're done! A team member will review your changes, request modifications if needed and merge it with TTE.

### Media

One important thing that you may question when making changes is how to handle media.

For videos, you can either link a third-party source (such as an youtube link) or add a video manually to the project (on the media folder). Videos are MP4 480p 30fps with a bitrate of 1000 for games before Zestiria and 2500 for Zestiria and newer games. All videos must have no audio (unless required).

For images, you can just put the link on the tech page and it will automatically appear on the page. Images that are a part of something else (such as game logos) should  have a small file size (>100KB, webp format).

## Enhancements, Bug Fixes and Other

For all other modifications, you can also follow the same tips as above -- create an issue or a pull request with your changes.
