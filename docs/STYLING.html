<h1 id=document-styling>Document Styling</h1><p>This document will go over the styling guide for markdown files in the TTE project.<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that was chosen to keep track of game-specific documents and pages like this one. The purpose of using markdown is to make it easier for editors to write documents while still being able to use that data in the browser.<p>The format of Markdown used is a subset of GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown). Thus, you can also have an idea of how the page looks by looking at the markdown file while in Github. Most of the original Markdown syntax also works on GFM and multiple guides are available online for both.<p>Here we will discuss how to use GFM for the TTE project and how to format pages to keep the same format throughout the site. To help in understanding this document, open the raw version of this file (located in docs/STYLING.md) and follow along with the examples.<h2 id=text>Text</h2><p>Text in GFM does not need any special formatting. The only specific rule is that line breaks are only considered when at least one line is blank between paragraphs. While you can also create a new line by having the previous line end with two spaces, this is not recommended. Not only will it break styling in TTE, but it will also make certain syntaxes fail.<p>Feel free to use new lines sparingly to make the text easier to read. They should also be used when you want to use a special effect such as spoiler tags, colored text, or tagging.<p>The following subsections show how you can use markdown to style your text. If you wish to use a symbol that is reserved (e.g., _ for italics, or $ for equations), prefix the symbol with an \.<h3 id=text-decorations>Text Decorations</h3><p>You can decorate your text with <strong>bold</strong> (text between double asterisks or underscores) and <em>italics</em> (text between single asterisk or underscore). You can also mix <strong><em>both</em></strong>.<p>Strikethrough can be used by using <del>two</del> tildes.<h3 id=headings>Headings</h3><p>Headings can be defined by starting the line with a hashtag (#). In TTE we use the first heading (#) for the game title. The second heading (##) are categories, which define the current content focus on the page (only one category active at a time). The third heading (###) is for sub-titles. Finally, the fourth heading (####) is for mechanics, tech, and glitch definitions.<p>Headings can be used freely, but try to use the same categories as other pages.<p>Headings should not have any special characters such as colons, quotes, or exclamation marks (only dashes are allowed). They should also not be used inside quote blocks or have the same name as another heading in the current file.<h3 id=ordered-and-unordered-lists>Ordered and Unordered Lists</h3><p>Ordered lists can be created by starting the lines with a number and a period. Here is an example:<ol><li>This is the first item.<li>This is the second item.</ol><p>An unordered list can be created by starting the lines with a hyphen. Here is another example:<ul><li>This is the first item... but in an unordered list that doesn't matter much.<li>And I'm the second item!</ul><h3 id=links>Links</h3><p>Links in markdown can be attributed to any word by encapsulating the word in brackets and the link in parentheses. The link has to follow the closing bracket of the word. Here is an <a href=http://example.com/>example</a>.<h3 id=tables>Tables</h3><p>Tables are part of the GFM syntax and can be created like the example below:<table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Beep<th style=text-align:center>No.<th style=text-align:right>Boop<tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>beep<td style=text-align:center>1024<td style=text-align:right>xyz<tr><td style=text-align:left>boop<td style=text-align:center>338845<td style=text-align:right>tuv<tr><td style=text-align:left>foo<td style=text-align:center>10106<td style=text-align:right>qrstuv<tr><td style=text-align:left>bar<td style=text-align:center>45<td style=text-align:right>lmno</table><p>They use pipes/vertical bars to define the columns. New lines in the document become new lines in the table. Hyphens can be used to separate the table heading from the table data. Trailing colons are optional and define the alignment of further elements in the table (left, right, or center). Here is an example of a delimiter row:<p>| :- | :-: | --: | :- | -: |<p>The number of hyphens itself does not matter. However, you can use different numbers to make the table easier to read in text format (by keeping them the same size as the table heading).<h3 id=quote-blocks>Quote Blocks</h3><p>Quote blocks can be created by starting a line with a greater-than sign (>). They can have multiple levels if needed. If you wish to continue the quote in another line, finish the current line with two empty spaces.<blockquote><p>Quote blocks can be created by starting a line with a greater-than sign (>).<blockquote><p>They can have multiple levels if needed.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you wish to continue the quote in another line,<br> finish the current line with two empty spaces.</blockquote><h3 id=mathematical-expressions>Mathematical Expressions</h3><p>TTE also supports LaTeX expressions. These can be placed in-line by encompassing the equation with the "$" symbol or as a block by putting the equation between lines with the "$$" symbol.<p>This is an example of an inline equation: <span class="tagging-katex tagging-computed"><span class=katex><span class=katex-mathml><math xmlns=http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=application/x-tex>E=mc^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=true class=katex-html><span class=base><span class=strut style=height:.6833em></span><span class="mord mathnormal"style=margin-right:.05764em>E</span><span class=mspace style=margin-right:.2778em></span><span class=mrel>=</span><span class=mspace style=margin-right:.2778em></span></span><span class=base><span class=strut style=height:.8141em></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class=mord><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class=msupsub><span class=vlist-t><span class=vlist-r><span class=vlist style=height:.8141em><span style=margin-right:.05em;top:-3.063em><span class=pstrut style=height:2.7em></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. Text can continue after it.<p>And this is a block equation:<p><span class="tagging-katex tagging-computed"><span class=katex><span class=katex-mathml><math xmlns=http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo fence=true>(</mo><mfrac linethickness=0px><mi>n</mi><mi>k</mi></mfrac><mo fence=true>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=false>!</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy=false>!</mo><mo stretchy=false>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy=false>)</mo><mo stretchy=false>!</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding=application/x-tex>\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=true class=katex-html><span class=base><span class=strut style=vertical-align:-.35em;height:1.2em></span><span class=mord><span class="mopen delimcenter"style=top:0><span class="delimsizing size1">(</span></span><span class=mfrac><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class=vlist-r><span class=vlist style=height:.7454em><span style=top:-2.355em><span class=pstrut style=height:2.7em></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight"style=margin-right:.03148em>k</span></span></span></span><span style=top:-3.144em><span class=pstrut style=height:2.7em></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span><span class=vlist-s>​</span></span><span class=vlist-r><span class=vlist style=height:.345em><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose delimcenter"style=top:0><span class="delimsizing size1">)</span></span></span><span class=mspace style=margin-right:.2778em></span><span class=mrel>=</span><span class=mspace style=margin-right:.2778em></span></span><span class=base><span class=strut style=vertical-align:-.52em;height:1.4001em></span><span class=mord><span class="mopen nulldelimiter"></span><span class=mfrac><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class=vlist-r><span class=vlist style=height:.8801em><span style=top:-2.655em><span class=pstrut style=height:3em></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight"style=margin-right:.03148em>k</span><span class="mclose mtight">!</span><span class="mopen mtight">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span><span class="mbin mtight">−</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight"style=margin-right:.03148em>k</span><span class="mclose mtight">)!</span></span></span></span><span style=top:-3.23em><span class=pstrut style=height:3em></span><span class=frac-line style=border-bottom-width:.04em></span></span><span style=top:-3.394em><span class=pstrut style=height:3em></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span><span class="mclose mtight">!</span></span></span></span></span><span class=vlist-s>​</span></span><span class=vlist-r><span class=vlist style=height:.52em><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose nulldelimiter"></span></span></span></span></span></span><h3 id=extended-syntax>Extended Syntax</h3><p>TTE also has an extended syntax separate from Markdown. This syntax is used to define new "directives" -- special tags to add new functionality to a manuscript. The following directives are available:<blockquote><p><strong>Colored Text</strong></blockquote><p>The colored text syntax works by either using an emphasis symbol (*) or heading symbol (#) followed by a colon (:) and the name of the effect.<p>The list of available parameters is as follows:<ul><li>:r — <span class=red> Red</span> Text.<li>:g — <span class=green> Green</span> Text.<li>:b — <span class=blue> Blue</span> Text.<li>:y — <span class=yellow> Yellow</span> Text.<li>:p — <span class=pink> Pink</span> Text.<li>:t — <span class=teal> Teal</span> Text.</ul><blockquote><p><strong>Spoiler</strong></blockquote><p>Used to hide content that may contain spoilers. The content is hidden by default and can be revealed by clicking. Create spoiler text by surrounding content with double exclamation marks: !!spoiler content!!. Do not use spaces between the exclamation marks and the text.<p><strong>Example</strong>: !!Spoiler!! becomes: <span class=spoiler>Spoiler</span>.<blockquote><p><strong>TODO</strong></blockquote><p>Signifies something is being worked on or tested. It is made up of an icon that, when hovered, shows a tooltip informing the reader that the section is under construction. Create a TODO marker by using double curly braces with an exclamation mark: {{!}}. TODO icons look better at the end of lines, without any characters after them.<p>These icons can also be used in headings. In this case, they should be placed just after the heading symbols (e.g., ### {{!}} Heading). This will render the icon automatically at the end of the heading.<p><strong>Example</strong>: A TODO block can be inserted into text like this {{!}} and it renders as this: <span class="tagging-text tagging-computed"data-tags="{'todo' : true}"><span data-tte-tooltip-text="This section needs work, is not confirmed or needs testing."class=material-symbols-rounded data-tte-todo-trigger style=color:#daa520;cursor:help;margin-right:15px>error</span></span><blockquote><p><strong>Versions</strong></blockquote><p>Shows a version-specific icon alongside the text. It has a simple tooltip when hovered. Create version tags by using double curly braces around the version name. Like TODO icons, they look better at the end of lines and can also be used in headings. The syntax is {{version}}.<p>Versions of the same name will maintain the same color throughout the game article.<p><strong>Example</strong>: The {{SNES}} syntax will result in: <span class="tagging-text tagging-computed"data-tags="{'versions' : 'SNES'}"><span data-tte-tooltip-text="Version: SNES."class=material-symbols-rounded data-tte-version-trigger style=cursor:help;filter:brightness(1.5);color:#f8d959;margin-right:15px>devices</span></span><blockquote><p><strong>Media</strong></blockquote><p>Directive for images or videos. They can be forced to display in the page, or hidden within an icon that needs to be clicked. Create media by using double square brackets with the Media prefix: [[Media:url]]. Add a pipe and caption text for captions: [[Media:url|caption]]. And prefix with an exclamation mark to hide the media behind a clickable icon: [[!Media:url]]. You can also combine hidden media with captions: [[!Media:url|caption]]<p>If not hidden, a media element should be placed on its own line. This will create an large embedded element with the image/video and the caption, if used. If hidden, it should be placed at the end of a line, similarly to the TODO and version icons. Additionally, the media can be used in headings, where it will be rendered at the end of the heading in case of hidden media, or just after it if not.<p><strong>Example</strong>: The following syntax: [[!Media:media/todps2/push.mp4|Example caption.]] is a hidden media. It will render the following icon: <span class="tagging-text tagging-computed"data-tags="{ 'media' : 'media/todps2/push.mp4', 'caption' : 'Example caption.', 'forcedmedia' : false }"><span data-media-caption="Example caption."class=material-symbols-rounded data-media-src=media/todps2/push.mp4 data-media-type=video data-tte-media-icon style=cursor:pointer;margin-right:15px>play_circle</span></span><blockquote><p><strong>Redirect</strong></blockquote><p>Allows you to create a link to a heading of a tech page or create numbered references.<p>For numbered references, use double square brackets around a number: [[1]]. These will redirect to the "References" section of the current article.<p>For internal page links, use double square brackets around the heading name: [[Manual Cancel]]. The heading name should be the same as one used in the page.<p>For custom display text, add a pipe and the text you want to show: [[Manual Cancel|cancel]]<p>For cross-page links, use curly braces with the document acronym before the heading name: [[{TOV}Manual Cancel]]. You can also combine this with custom display text: [[{TOV}Manual Cancel|cancel]]<p>Due to the way redirections are styled, they can be used with no issues in the middle of a paragraph.<p><strong>Example</strong>: The syntax [[{TODPS2}Stagger Manipulation|TODPS2 Redirect]] will redirect you to the Stagger Manipulation entry in the TODPS2 article. It renders down to this: <span class="tagging-computed content__redirect"data-section="Tales of Destiny"data-tags="{ 'redirect' : '#stagger-manipulation', 'document' : 'TODPS2' }"data-document=TODPS2 data-redirect=#stagger-manipulation><span class=material-symbols-rounded style=margin-right:5px>link</span>TODPS2 Redirect</span>. A paragraph can continue as normal after it.<h2 id=default-format-for-a-tech-page>Default Format for a Tech Page</h2><p>While TTE does not currently enforce a strict format, the following hierarchy is expected for headings. The first heading (#) is only used for the game title. The second (##) is used for category definitions (Mechanics, Glitches...). The third (###) is used to start a subsection in that category (broad topic or for an important tech). Finally, the fourth heading (####) is used for glitches and tech definitions.<p>Every tech page starts with a heading (#) of the game name followed by a list of versions that will be tackled in the document. A name for each of these versions should also be given, and that name should be used in custom directives (with the versions tag) for version-specific segments.<p>The second heading (##) is used for category definitions. While you can create categories as you see fit, the following is the default format:<ul><li><strong>"Mechanics"</strong>: This category is used for general game mechanics that are mostly explained in-game. It should be a general overview of the battle system. <span class=red> <strong>Mandatory.</strong></span><li><strong>"Techniques"</strong>: This category is used for techniques and glitches that are related to the battle system. <span class=red> <strong>Mandatory.</strong></span><li><strong>"Glitches"</strong>: This category is used for glitches that are not related to the battle system (such as exploration). <span class=red> <strong>Mandatory.</strong></span><li><strong>"Misc"</strong>: This category is used for any other information that does not fit in the previous categories. Minor techniques that don't affect the game as much (for example, an animation breaking) should also be placed here. When in doubt, check the Misc category of other pages. Version differences can also be placed here.<li><strong>"References"</strong>: References for the current page. <span class=red> <strong>Mandatory.</strong></span></ul><p>As a general tip, use images, videos, tables, and formulas as much as you can to break the page flow and make things easier to read. A full view (1 screen on desktop and 2 screens on mobile) with only text can be tiring to read and can cause users to skip ahead.<p>The page will be automatically divided for each second heading. A table of contents will also be added to link to the third and fourth headings of the section. Finally, any third and fourth heading inside "Techniques" or "Glitches" will be added to the search menu.<p>Pages can also be created for two other articles, being:<ul><li>"Characters": Includes a summary of each playable character and important parameters for their artes, serving as a reference for players. It also should include character-specific mechanics, glitches, and techniques. May also include strategy (game mechanic) and boss information, glitches, and oddities.<li>"Bosses": Spoiler article containing a reference for the game's bosses.</ul><h2 id=other-resources>Other Resources</h2><p>You probably can edit a page by simply following the syntax of other pages, but in case you want further definitions of GFM and Markdown syntax, you can follow these links: <a href=https://github.github.com/gfm/>GFM</a>, <a href=https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/>Markdown</a>.
