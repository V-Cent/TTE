<h1 id=document-styling>Document Styling</h1><p>This document will go over the styling guide for markdown files in the TTE project.<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that was chosen to keep track of game-specific documents and pages like this one. The purpose of using markdown is to make it easier for editors to write documents while still being able to use that data in the browser.<p>The format of Markdown used is a subset of GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown). Thus, you can also have an idea of how the page looks by looking at the markdown file while in Github. Most of the original Markdown syntax also works on GFM and multiple guides are available online for both.<p>Here we will discuss how to use GFM for the TTE project and how to format pages to keep the same format throughout the site. To help in understanding this document, open the raw version of this file (located in docs/STYLING.md) and follow along with the examples.<h2 id=text>Text</h2><p>Text in GFM does not need any special formatting. The only specific rule is that line breaks are only considered when at least one line is blank between paragraphs. While you can also create a new line by having the previous line in two spaces, this is not recommended. Not only will it break styling in TTE, but it will also make certain syntaxes fail.<p>Feel free to use new lines sparingly to make the text easier to read. They should also be used when you want to use a special effect such as spoiler tags, colored text, or tagging.<p>The following subsections show how you can use markdown to style your text. If you wish to use a symbol that is reserved (e.g., _ for italics, or $ for equations), prefix the symbol with an \.<h3 id=text-decorations>Text Decorations</h3><p>You can decorate your text with <strong>bold</strong> (text between double asterisks or underscores) and <em>italics</em> (text between single asterisk or underscore). You can also mix <strong><em>both</em></strong>.<p>Strikethrough can be used by using <del>two</del> tildes.<h3 id=headings>Headings</h3><p>Headings can be defined by starting the line with a hashtag (#). In TTE we use the first heading (#) for the game title. The second heading (##) are categories, which define the current content focus on the page (only one category active at a time). The third heading (###) is for sub-titles. Finally, the fourth heading (####) is for mechanics, tech, and glitch definitions.<p>Headings can be used freely, but try to use the same categories as other pages.<p>Heading should not have any special characters such as colons, quotes, or exclamation marks (only dashes are allowed). They should also not be used inside quote blocks or have the same name as another heading in the current file.<h3 id=ordered-and-unordered-lists>Ordered and Unordered Lists</h3><p>Ordered lists can be created by starting the lines with a number and a period. Here is an example:<ol><li>This is the first item.<li>This is the second item.</ol><p>An unordered list can be created by starting the lines with a hyphen. Here is another example:<ul><li>This is the first item... but in an unordered list that doesn't matter much.<li>And I'm the second item!</ul><h3 id=links>Links</h3><p>Links in markdown can be attributed to any word by encapsulating the word in brackets and the link in parentheses. The link has to follow the closing bracket of the word. Heres is an <a href=http://example.com/>example</a>.<h3 id=tables>Tables</h3><p>Tables are part of the GFM syntax and can be created like the example below:<table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Beep<th style=text-align:center>No.<th style=text-align:right>Boop<tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>beep<td style=text-align:center>1024<td style=text-align:right>xyz<tr><td style=text-align:left>boop<td style=text-align:center>338845<td style=text-align:right>tuv<tr><td style=text-align:left>foo<td style=text-align:center>10106<td style=text-align:right>qrstuv<tr><td style=text-align:left>bar<td style=text-align:center>45<td style=text-align:right>lmno</table><p>They use pipes/vertical bars to define the columns. New lines in the document defined new lines in the table. Hyphens can be used to separate the table heading from the table data. Trailing colons are optional and define the alignment of further elements in the table (left right or center). Here is an example of a delimiter row:<p>| :- | :-: | --: | :- | -: |<p>The number of hyphens itself does not matter. However, you can use different numbers to make the table easier to read in text format (by keeping them the same size as the table heading).<h3 id=quote-blocks>Quote Blocks</h3><p>Quote blocks can be created by starting a line with a greater-than sign (>). They can have multiple levels if needed. If you wish to continue the quote in another line, finish the current line with two empty spaces.<blockquote><p>Quote blocks can be created by starting a line with a greater-than sign (>).<blockquote><p>They can have multiple levels if needed.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you wish to continue the quote in another line,<br> finish the current line with two empty spaces.</blockquote><h3 id=mathematical-expressions>Mathematical Expressions</h3><p>TTE also supports LaTeX expressions. These can be placed in-line by encompassing the equation with the "$" symbol or as a block by putting the equation between lines with the "$$" symbol.<p>This is an example of an inline equation: <span class="tagging-katex tagging-computed"><span class=katex><span class=katex-mathml><math xmlns=http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=application/x-tex>E=mc^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=true class=katex-html><span class=base><span class=strut style=height:.6833em></span><span class="mord mathnormal"style=margin-right:.05764em>E</span><span class=mspace style=margin-right:.2778em></span><span class=mrel>=</span><span class=mspace style=margin-right:.2778em></span></span><span class=base><span class=strut style=height:.8141em></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class=mord><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class=msupsub><span class=vlist-t><span class=vlist-r><span class=vlist style=height:.8141em><span style=margin-right:.05em;top:-3.063em><span class=pstrut style=height:2.7em></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

Emphasis symbols should be used for text and be closed by another emphasis symbol. Header Symbol should only be used for headers and are closed by a new line. Only use underscores or tildes for text decoration when using the extended syntax.<p>The list of available parameters is as follows:<ul><li>:! — <span class=spoiler> Spoiler Tag.</span><li>:r — <span class=red> Red</span> Text.<li>:g — <span class=green> Green</span> Text.<li>:b — <span class=blue> Blue</span> Text.<li>:y — <span class=yellow> Yellow</span> Text.<li>:p — <span class=pink> Pink</span> Text.<li>:t — <span class=teal> Teal</span> Text.<li>:{ — Start of a custom directive.</ul><p>Custom directives are tags to modify the behavior of pages. They are JSON objects that are injected as the parent of the current text. Here is a simple example of a custom directive: {'versions' : 'TTE'}<p>By using the emphasis symbol, you can even use them without text to insert something in a line (for example, a video). For example, the custom direction above, when inserted in an empty line, becomes this:<p><span class="tagging-text tagging-computed"data-tags="{'versions' : 'TTE'}"><span data-tte-tooltip-text="Version: TTE."class=material-symbols-rounded data-tte-version-trigger style=cursor:help;filter:brightness(1.5);color:#45c9c9;margin-right:15px>devices</span></span><p>Most custom directives also work with headings. In these cases, the first colon should also have one space before it. An example: ### :{ 'versions' : 'TTE', 'todo' : true} Heading3.<p>For emphasis, you can also group a block of text within it, to tag a specific portion of your paragraph:<p><span class="tagging-text tagging-computed"data-tags="{'versions' : 'TTE', 'todo' : true}">This is a test!<span data-tte-tooltip-text="Version: TTE."class=material-symbols-rounded data-tte-version-trigger style=cursor:help;filter:brightness(1.5);color:#45c9c9;margin-right:15px>devices</span><span data-tte-tooltip-text="This section needs work, is not confirmed or needs testing."class=material-symbols-rounded data-tte-todo-trigger style=color:#daa520;cursor:help;margin-right:15px>error</span></span><p>Parameters should always be encapsulated in braces. The name of each parameter is set between single quotes ('); the same should be done for text values.<p>The following is a list of custom directives:<blockquote><p><strong>TODO</strong></blockquote><p>Signifies something is being worked on or tested. It has a simple tooltip when hovered. When used, it will create an icon after the text content. Options for this directive are:<ul><li>'todo' : true (if true, enables this directive)</ul><p>Example: This is a TODO. <span class="tagging-text tagging-computed"data-tags="{'todo' : true}"><span data-tte-tooltip-text="This section needs work, is not confirmed or needs testing."class=material-symbols-rounded data-tte-todo-trigger style=color:#daa520;cursor:help;margin-right:15px>error</span></span><blockquote><p><strong>Versions</strong></blockquote><p>Shows a version-specific icon alongside the text. It has a simple tooltip when hovered. Options for this directive are:<ul><li>'version' : 'text' (text will be shown as a tooltip)</ul><p>Example: This is a version icon. <span class="tagging-text tagging-computed"data-tags="{'versions' : 'SNES'}"><span data-tte-tooltip-text="Version: SNES."class=material-symbols-rounded data-tte-version-trigger style=cursor:help;filter:brightness(1.5);color:#58f15b;margin-right:15px>devices</span></span><blockquote><p><strong>Media</strong></blockquote><p>Directive for images or videos. Should only be added in the middle of text or for fourth headings (####). They can be forced in the page, or hidden within an icon that needs to be clicked. Options for this directive are:<ul><li>'media' : 'url' (url of video or image)<li>'forcedmedia' : false (optional; default is true; if false, the media is hidden in a button)<li>'caption' : 'text' (optional; text will be added as a caption)</ul><p>Example: This is an example video. <span class="tagging-text tagging-computed"data-tags="{'media' : 'media/todps2/push.mp4', 'forcedmedia' : false, 'caption' : 'Example caption.' }"><span data-media-caption="Example caption."class=material-symbols-rounded data-media-src=media/todps2/push.mp4 data-media-type=video data-tte-media-icon style=cursor:pointer;margin-right:15px>play_circle</span></span><blockquote><p><strong>Redirect</strong></blockquote><p>Allows you to create a link to a heading of a tech page. Requires you to provide the link to the specific heading by using the following syntax: #name-of-the-heading. This can only be used in text, not for headings. Options for this directive are:<ul><li>'redirect' : '#link' (id of heading)<li>'document' : 'text' (optional; use to redirect to different game pages; must be the acronym of the game title)</ul><p>Example: This is an example redirect (will bring you to the Tales of Destiny PS2 page). <span class="tagging-computed content__redirect"data-section="Tales of Destiny"data-tags="{'redirect' : '#stagger-techniques', 'document' : 'TODPS2'}"data-document=TODPS2 data-redirect=#stagger-techniques><span class=material-symbols-rounded style=margin-right:5px>link</span>Stagger Techniques</span><p>Additionally, you can also create redirects for references. When doing this, using the 'redirect' or 'document' options are not needed. Use the text content to signify the number of the reference, like for example this {'reference' : true}1* (the first emphasis symbol was removed to show this in raw text).<ul><li>'reference' : true (if true, the icon will be omitted and the link will go to the references tab)</ul><h2 id=default-format-for-a-tech-page>Default Format for a Tech Page</h2><p>While TTE does not currently enforce a strict format, the following hierarchy is expected for headings. The first heading (#) is only used for the game title. The second (##) is used for category definitions (Mechanics, Glitches...). The third (###) is used to start a subsection in that category (broad topic or for an important tech). Finally, the fourth heading (####) is used for glitches and tech definitions.<p>Every tech page starts with a heading (#) of the game name followed by a list of versions that will be tackled in the document. A name for each of these versions should also be given, and that name should be used in custom directives (with the versions tag) for version-specific segments.<p>The second heading (##) is used for category definitions. While you can create categories as you see fit, the following is the default format:<ul><li>"Mechanics": This category is used for general game mechanics that are mostly explained in-game. It should be a general overview of the battle system. <span class=red> <strong>Mandatory.</strong></span><li>"Techniques": This category is used for techniques and glitches that are related to the battle system. <span class=red> <strong>Mandatory.</strong></span><li>"Glitches": This category is used for glitches that are not related to the battle system (such as exploration). <span class=red> <strong>Mandatory.</strong></span><li>"Misc": This category is used for any other information that does not fit in the previous categories. Minor techniques that don't affect the game as much (for example, an animation breaking) should also be placed here. When in doubt, check the Misc category of other pages. Version differences can also be placed here.<li>"References": References for the current page. <span class=red> <strong>Mandatory.</strong></span></ul><p>As a general tip, use images, videos, tables, and formulas as much as you can to break the page flow and make things easier to read. A full view (1 screen on desktop and 2 screens on mobile) with only text can be tiring to read and can cause users to skip ahead.<p>The page will be automatically divided for each second heading. A table of contents will also be added to link to the third and fourth headings of the section. Finally, any third and fourth heading inside "Techniques" or "Glitches" will be added to the search menu.<p>Pages can also be created for two other articles, being:<ul><li>"Characters": Includes a summary of each playable character and important parameters for their artes, serving as a reference for players. It also should include character-specific mechanics, glitches, and techniques. May also include strategy (game mechanic) and boss information, glitches, and oddities.<li>"Bosses": Spoiler article containing a reference for the game's bosses.</ul><h2 id=other-resources>Other Resources</h2><p>You probably can edit a page by simply following the syntax of other pages, but in case you want further definitions of GFM and Markdown syntax, you can follow these links: <a href=https://github.github.com/gfm/>GFM</a>, <a href=https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/>Markdown</a>.
