## Table of Contents

## Base Mechanics

Here will be displayed a simple description of the base mechanics of the game. Most of these are already explained during gameplay, but may have some effects that were only found out during experimentation.

### Stats

**Strength (STR)** influences your P. Attack greatly, and P. Defense slightly. It also affects how much Guard and Iron Stance damage is dealt to enemies.

**Intelligence (INT)** influences your A. Attack greatly, and A. Defense slightly. It also increases your ailment success rate.

**Vitality (VIT)** influences your P. Defense greatly, and P. Attack slightly. It also lessens the amount of Guard damage you take.

**Psyche (PSY)** influences your A. Defense greatly, and A. Attack slightly. It also lowers the ailment success rate of attacks that hit you.

**Agility (AGI)** influences your P. Attack and A. Attack slightly. It also affects your movement speed.

**Dexterity (DEX)** influences your P. Defense and A. Defense slightly. It also increases your critical hit rate.

### Knockdown Limit

Bosses can only be knocked down three times before they will gain Iron Stance and cannot be OTG'd afterwards outside of very specific means. If a boss is knocked down in the air, and then OTG'd before they touch the ground, it will not count towards the KD limit.

## Glitches

In this section, we have a group of glitches and a small description on how to replicate/explain them. In this section, you will not find glitches that are currently useful for combat, this is found on the next segment.

### New Game+ Glitch

Select New Game+ From the title screen and load a clear save when prompted. After the loading is complete but before the Grade Shop pops up, press Start and Quick Save. You now have glitched your NG+.

#### "Story" Changes

The Julius fight at the start will now have your skills from the loaded game applied to it (you still won't be able to use artes, swap weapons, stagger or defeat Julius, however); for example, if Ludger had Grounded Stance active on the save you used for NG+, Julius cannot stagger him to trigger the cutscene and advance the fight. You will have to wait for him to use Overlimit and hit you with Moonlight Assault instead.

After the tutorial fight, you can change Ludger's weapons, change his skills, and even access the world map right from the start. Interestingly enough, the Spirius Gatekeeper Boss here level scales quite highly, despite being the first boss in the game and would otherwise be unfeasible to reach its level cap in a normal playthrough or NG+

Afterwards, the story cannot be progressed past the Trigleph Train, as Julius won't be there to trigger the Fractured Dimension. You can even use the world map to warp to Canaan, but you can't fight the final bosses either. The only bosses available are the Spirius Gatekeeper, the Coliseum, and the EX Dungeon.

#### "Fractured" Milla Returns

If you use the World Map to warp to a town, you'll gain access to the entire party again. Just like Ludger, they retain everything from the clear save used for this NG+. The only notable change is that Milla will use her Fractured voice lines, despite it being Prime Milla in the party. Through this, you can hear voice lines for artes Fractured Milla never had access to. Namely: The Great Spirit summons, Elemental Shot, and all three of her Mystic Artes.

## Combat Techniques

Here we will discuss various different techniques/glitches that can be used during combat.

### General Techniques

#### Weakness Resets

:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tox2/kd1.mp4', 'forcedvideo' : true}"}
Generally, the only way to consistently keep a boss in a combo is through a Power Combo. However, it is possible to do multiple power combos within a single combo, by timing the end of the power hits gauge to line up with a well placed weakness hit. There are multiple ways to go about these weakness resets, which will be explained below.
:::

:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tox2/kd2.mp4', 'forcedvideo' : true}"}
**OTG:** Knock down the boss right as the Power Hits gauge is about to expire, and then OTG them with their weakness. You can also hit them with their weakness while they're downed and then OTG them with a different arte, as bosses can't trigger counters while knocked down. You can also knockdown bosses in the air. Aerial knockdowns do not contribute towards to the KD limit, as long as they are OTG'd before touching the ground. In addition, human bosses will attempt to air recover at the earliest possible opportunity, requiring a near instant OTG to retain the combo.
:::

:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tox2/launch.mp4', 'forcedvideo' : true}"}
**Unclean Hits:** If the KD limit has been reached, the boss will gain Iron Stance to prevent you from continuing your combo. You can bypass this by petrifying them, hitting their weakness and then breaking their Iron Stance while they are frozen, in that order. Alternatively, you can also stun them with an arte that OTGs, such as Stun Blitz or backwards Hammer Flail, or use an arte with the Iron Stance Break property after hitting a weakness while they're downed.
:::

:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tox2/landing.mp4', 'forcedvideo' : true}"}
**Counter Cancel (Launch):** Wait for gauge to run out and hit the enemy with an attack that both launches upwards and hits a weakness. This will trigger a counter and depending on the boss will be RNG dependant. The counter will be rolled from their ground-counter pool and for this to work they have to use an attack that can only be used on the ground. After the superarmor wears off hit with another element to resume comboing normally.
:::

**Counter Cancel (Landing):** Essentially the opposite of the launch method. Have the enemy airborne as the gauge is about to run out, then hit with anything that doesn't juggle or give the enemy more air time AND hit a weakness. This relies on the air-counter pool to roll with an attack that can only be used in the air and get cancelled as they land before they can use it. After the superarmor wears off hit with another element to resume comboing normally.

Outside of the obvious utility of combo extention and DPS, weakness resets can also be used to limit your own damage or element usage, without sacrificing combo length. As a practical example, some Elite Monsters will "break" after hitting them with too many elements in a Power Combo. By using weakness resets to let Power Hits end at a low multiplier, and then continue a fresh Power Hits chain from scratch, you can keep your combos going freely.

#### No Weakness Juggling

For bosses that have no air counter, it is possible to juggle them in the air without the use of power combos. This is particularly useful for some bosses that have no weaknesses such as Chronos 1 and Victor (Hammer or Guns only). To do this, you must bait out their Overlimit first by launching them and attacking them while they're airborne. Without an air counter, they will be forced to use their Overlimit instead to escape. After their Overlimit runs out, they will have no means of escape for 60 seconds until it recharges. As long as the boss isn't standing on the ground, you can juggle them freely during this time. Be aware that the boss can still recover from an aerial knockdown, but as long as they don't land, you can still keep the combo going.

#### Linked Arte Cancel (LAC)

Similar to Fatal Strikes from Vesperia, you can cancel the animation of any arte with a Linked Arte as long as the glyph is active. For example, you can use Demon Fist as Jude, then use Dragon Shot, and cancel Dragon Shot by using the Linked Arte from Demon Fist. If the character is airborne, this will cause them to fall to the ground similarly to the Quick Drop skill.

For Linked artes that are spells (such as Rock Hexad), you can spell cancel them by guarding, just as you would a normal spell. Using this in tandem with LAC can allow you to cancel an arte at virtually any point and continue as normal. If your character has the Casting Window skill, you can also have the Linked Arte glyph come out before the intiial spell comes out.

In both cases of LAC, artes with lingering hitboxes benefit greatly from this tech. Such artes include traps (such as Mine Collapse or Sun Spark), artes that have a delayed reaction (such as Light of Ruin and Squall Shot), and spells such as Flame Ring.

### Miscellaneous Techniques

#### Elemental Shift

When you use a non-elemental multi-hit arte, or a projectlile such as Demon Fang or Pulse Shot, you can change the element of the arte while it's already out by opening the menu and changing your weapons to an different element. The color of the arte won't change, but it will take on the attributes of the newly equipped weapon. This is handy for hitting a specific weakness in a pinch or to land a status ailment without being completely tied to its respective element.

For Ludger specifically, his weapon swap mechanic serves the same purpose and can be used to alter the elements of (Double) Demon Fang and Pow Hammer without the use of a menu.

## Character Specific Tech/Arte Info

### Ludger

#### Falling Snow

One of the most flexible Artes on a character famous for his versatility, Falling Snow (abbreviated as FS) is a staple of Ludger's kit and can find immediate value in just about any aspect of his gameplay. To start with a short summary of FS's positives, it has:

-Near instant startup

-Travels about a third of the screen in about half a second

-Long hitstun; long enough to AC reset from for free

-Air OK

-OTG

FS is a single hit, non-elemental slash arte, which makes it very valuable as a combo starter and general combo tool for its speed and distance. It also serves as a cornerstone of combo resets thanks to its OTG property and it pairing really nicely with elemental weapons.

If Ludger goes through an enemy with FS, he will turn around at the end of the arte to face them. If FS collides with an enemy from max distance, Ludger will end the arte face first in front of the enemy. He won't turn around and the recovery frames are greatly reduced.

As a mobility tool, FS is invaluable for the amount of space it covers for how fast it is, and how it can singlehandedly invalidate some artes such as Tetra Spell by speeding past all the hitboxes. FS doesn't actually have invul frames though, so be mindful of that when using it to evade artes that hit a wide range or are also just as fast, like Gnome II.

It is worth noting that despite this arte having a lot of positives, it does have one minor, but not insignificant flaw. If you swap to Hammer or Guns right after FS, your hurtbox will extend to the distance you travelled, which can leave you vulnerable if you plan to use this Arte as an evasion tool. This glitch can be sidestepped by, well, sidestepping (or any other action) between using FS and the weapon swap.

**Reverse Falling Snow (RFS)** is an extention to FS that will come out by holding FS's arte shortcut and having the arte connect. RFS has different trajectories depending on if it is used on the ground or in the air.

Ground RFS has Ludger doing a second FS in the opposite direction of the first, which ends with him back turned to the foe instead of facing them. This is particularily useful for setting up backwards hitbox-based combos, or positioning for traps. Ground FS also causes human enemies and smaller to spin, which can be problematic for aformentioned hitbox abuse, depending on what you're fighting.

Air RFS has Ludger doing his second FS in a 45 degree angle upwards, reminiscent of Air Divide from Vesperia. Air RFS comes out faster than ground RFS and also lifts the enemy slightly in place. This variant is specialized for air juggles and the lifting effect pairs up nicely with artes like Migrating Sparrows, as well as Quick Drop to keep the enemy airborne for as long as possible.

**Chromatus Falling Snow (CFS)** is effectively a different arte than the rest, as it lacks a lot of the general utility that FS normally has, due to how CS mechanics work. But it shares enough properties and is one of CS's strongest artes, so its still worth discussing.

CFS is ground only, and will autocorrect you to face the enemy *before* the arte comes out, so it is more limited in a positioning sense. However it makes up for that by not only retaining its usual OTG property, but also comes with the rare *Iron Stance Break* property. This allows CS to break the OTG limit by bypassing the Iron Stance bosses obtain upon hitting the limit.

#### Traps (Mine Collapse/Bubble Blast/Meteoric Waltz)

[TODO]

### Milla

#### Aerial Spell Glitch

Normally, equipping the Aerial Spell skill disables Milla's ability to Spirit Shift her artes in the air. However, it is possible to use Aerial Spell without having the skill equipped, enabling Milla to use both versions of her artes in the air and greatly increasing her flexibility.

Use an arte while in the air and then input the spell you want to use while the current arte is being performed. Right as the spell is about to come out, either set Milla to Auto Mode or switch to another character. The timing is tight, but if done correctly Milla should transition into the spell instead of its shifted version.

Despite Elize and Muzét having access to Aerial Spell in Xillia 2, this tech is exclusive to Milla as it is a glitch involving the Spirit Shift mechanic.
