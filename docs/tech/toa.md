# Tales of Arise

[Tales of Arise](https://aselia.fandom.com/wiki/Tales_of_Arise) (テイルズ オブ アライズ Teiruzu obu Araizu) was released internationally on September 9, 2021 for the PS4, PS5, XBox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC.

## Base Mechanics

Here will be displayed a simple description of the base mechanics of the game. Most of these are already explained during gameplay, but may have some effects that were only found out during experimentation.

### Stats

Each character has 6 stats:

- Attack(_Phy.Atk_) → Non-elemental damage increase.
- Elemental Attack(_Ele.Atk_) → Elemental damage increase.
- Defense(_Phy.Def_) → Non-elemental inflicted decrease.
- Elemental Defense(_Ele.Def_) → Elemental damage inflicted decrease.
- Penetration(_Pen_) → Increase Critical Rate and chance to break enemies Evasion.
- Resistance(_Res_) → Decreases Enemy's Critical Rate and increases chances of activating Evasion.

Definitions:

**Evasion**: Chance to activate solid stance from attacks. This will prevent interruptions and enable you (or the enemy) to perform actions while being attacked. If an enemies' evasion is broken, a "Broken" pop-up will appear and you will be able to perform combos without retribution.

### Boost Attacks

Boost attacks are special attacks that serve both for mechanics and dealing damage. Each character's boost attack have different effects and will recover AG to the player character after it being executed.

The following are the effects of each boost attacks:

- Alphen: Consumes a small amount of HP to down the enemy (including bosses).
- Shionne: Downs flying enemies (or enemies that have taken flight) and prevents them from flying for a period of time.
- Rinwell: If the enemy is performing a spell, Rinwell will steal that spell (that you can use like any other stored spell) and prevent the enemy from casting for a period of time. If the enemy is not casting the boost attack will only temporally prevent it from casting.
- Law: Destroy the armor from armored enemies and downs them, letting them be staggered more easily (by reducing their Evasion chance) and reducing their defense.
- Kisara: Downs charging enemies and grants a defense buff to the whole party.
- Dohalim: Makes so that fleet-footed enemies will not dodge the party's attacks mid-chain. Will also down normal enemies on the final hit.

### Other information

**Chain Actions**

Tales of Arise has multiple actions you can use mid-chain to either dodge or attack the enemy. This includes the basic actions such as a normal attack, artes (and spells), boost attacks and strikes and dodges.

You can also backstep, which is performed by tapping the dodge button without holding a direction; jump, by pressing it on the correct timing and doing mystic artes when in overlimit by holding two arte buttons.

The spell casting animation can also be cancelled by dodges, jumps and backsteps.

While in a chain, you also persist your "position" on the normal attack chain (depending on the number of uses you did previously).

Your chain ends your character enters their neutral animation, which lets you walk around with the direction buttons (left-stick on controller).

**Arte Usage**

As you use your artes, you can gain stars that indicate that they were strengthened. The number of uses to gain each star is as follow:

- 1☆ = 100
- 2☆ = 500
- 3☆ = 1000
- 4☆ = 2000
- 5☆ = 3000

Arte usage only increases the damage done for that arte (6% per star).

**Spell Casting Mechanics**

Skill Needed: Reduced Arte Casting Time During Combos

Spell casting reductions in Tales of Arise all follow the same formula. Each "_action_" you perform will reduce your casting time by 4% X Number of "Reduced Arte Casting Time During Combos" skills.

Here's a list of what is considered an _action_:

- A Normal attack counts as 1 action.
- Starting a spell cast counts as 1 action and the actual release is also 1 action.
- Rinwell's Spell Charge/Hold And Spell Release both count as 1 action.
- A Physical Arte counts as 1 action.
- Bombs extensions count as 1 additional action.
- A Boost attack counts as 1 action.
- Counter Edges count as 1 action.

And what is **not** considered an _action_:

- Dodges, jumps and partner's boost strikes don't count as any action.
- Casting or releasing a support spell will not count as actions. They will, however, use the normal spell casting formula (thus their casting time can be reduced).

Other than actions, there is some important things to take note of:

- Hits/Whiffs do not matter. Steps do not matter. The AG cost of the move (and if it is an Arcane arte or not) does not matter.
- Maximum casting reduction is 80% of the original casting time but cannot go below 1s.
- Mystic Crest Accessories and casting time reduction bonuses reduce the casting time by a percentage. They do not affect the minimal casting time described above.
- Auto-mode is beneficial to spell casting due to the long hit stop animations in Manual or Semi-auto.
- Rinwell gets + 10% bonus casting speed per "Faster spell charge" skill if she charged a spell during the combo.
- Keep in mind that you usually get 2 actions of reduction when using spells, but by only releasing a spell (that was saved in the book) with Rinwell you get the reduction of only 1 action.

Therefore, to maximize your casting time your objective is to hit that 80% as fast as possible. This can be done easily by doing 10 actions while you have 2 "Reduced Arte Casting Time During Combos" skills, which can be done by casting 5 offensive spells. Rinwell can hit this limit even faster by using the "Faster spell charge" skill. Here are some examples of how it would work in the game:

> Normal Attack -> Thunder Lance -> Shooting Star = 1 action reduction to Thunder Lance. 3 actions reduction to Shooting star.  
> Sharpness (Hold) -> Shooting Star = 1 action reduction to Shooting star.  
> Air Thrust (Hold) -> Shooting Star = 2 actions reduction to Shooting star.

**Control Modes**

Tales of Arise, like other "Tales of" games, have three control modes: Auto, Semi-Auto and Manual.

Auto mode makes your characters be controlled automatically during battle. They will obey any current strategy and will not use artes that were disabled unless you manually tell them to (either by using a artes button or the menu).

In Semi-auto, the player can control the character and there are two mechanics to help the user in combo. They are axis-tracking, making moves automatically aim in a perfect line to the enemy; and distance control, making your character automatically move closer to perform actions that would otherwise whiff.

In Manual, all actions are performed by the user. Your character won't automatically move closer to the enemy to perform attacks and axis-tracking is only present if you're not pressing a direction.

## Glitches

In this section, we have a group of glitches and a small description on how to replicate/explain them. In this section, you will not find glitches that are currently useful for combat, this is found on the next segment.

### Minor Battle Glitches

#### :{'todo' : true} Artes getting stuck

Depending on your position, certain artes can get stuck on the enemy mesh slightly. This will result in your recovery taking longer and even enemies dropping from the combo. Can be mostly seem by using Air to Ground Moves while on top of an enemy.

Rarely, the enemy can also be slightly stuck on top of a character. However, these occurrences are rare and won't prevent an enemy from attacking.

#### :{'todo' : true} AI friendly-fire spells

If you manually tell the AI to cast a support spell on you and have him dodge an enemy attack, there is a chance that the AI will start casting an offensive spell right away and still keep its target on you.

### Out of Bounds and Sequence Breaks

#### :{'versions' : 'PC'} Berg Volcano Early

This skip works best on higher framerates. Set your frame rate as unlimited and resolution scale to 50 to have framerates higher than 144.

In the mine just after your first battles, go into one of the dead ends closed off by a fence. There, you can jump over the fence to Berg Volcano. This will let you fight some enemies earlier and get some equipment earlier. You can return later with Dohalim to proceed further in the dungeon to get more items and unlock the camping point (with the teleport). Even though you can use Dohalim here, you do not unlock his map actions outside of Berg Volcano. Also, returning during the story events that take place here will not result in skipping the dungeon entrance cutscene or boss. The only cutscene that can be skipped is a very small introduction to Dohalim's map action. Even if you skip it, you will still be able to use it outside of Berg Volcano.

The angle for this skip is strict. You can get better consistency by either using low sensibility on your mouse or decreasing the movement speed of the camera. Using the keyboard can also fix your movement to be always forward, which takes one variable off the jump. Change angle slightly from left to right until your character hangs mid-air on the fence. When your character is getting closer to the angle you will find that your first jump may fail (jump in place with no heigh difference), and if you run and jump again you may be stuck in the middle of the fence running (and if you jump you would have a difference stuck animation from the previous one, where you fall more than jump). Continue changing the angle and trying the jump until you can do a full jump from that hang spot. Then you can jump easily to the other side (higher up it becomes easier to jump and change angles)

### Exploits

#### Skill Glitch

On the skills menu, you can quickly pass your cursor over a skill and activate it just after it leaves the skill circle. This will cause the skill to still be selected after you close the "Learn skill" pop-up.

You can then proceed to use this glitch to select multiple skills at once. Once you're done, you can confirm the "Learn skill" pop-up for one of the skills and all selected skills will be learned.

There are a few important notes about this glitch:

- You can only select skills that you have enough SP for. This only counts for the skill you hover. Therefore you can, with 1000 SP, learn two 840 SP skills.
- After you learn the skills, your SP will be reduced by the sum of the skills chosen. If your current SP is lower than that amount, it will be reduced to 0.
- If you hover over an already selected skill, it will be de-selected. Be careful to not hover neighboring skills while you are doing the glitch to fill a title.
- This glitch is easier to do on PC with a mouse. When using a controller, one popular strategy is doing circles on the perimeter of a skill.

You can watch a more in-depth explanation of the exploit [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLCvRBacgI8).

#### Rare Variant Enemy Respawn

Rare variant enemy location is defined by an internal seed that changes every time you load your game or rest in an inn or camp. Therefore, you can get multiple of the same encounter by finding a rare encounter, defeating it, then fast traveling to a nearby fast travel point.

You can use this casually by simply fast traveling back after fighting the rare variant you want, or manipulate it by loading/resting close to the enemy formation that you want to become rare.

## Combat Techniques

Here we will discuss various different techniques/glitches that can be used during combat.

### General Techniques

#### Boost Attack Cancel

Using the boost attack of your character while you're doing an action will automatically cancel it. This can be useful with artes that have lingering hit-boxes.

#### Boost Attack Teleport

During a combo, you can change characters and use the boost attack of the character you were controlling to teleport that character to the side of the enemy.

#### Boost Attack Invincibility

Every Boost Attack is also gives you invincibility frames while you're doing it. This invincibility can even be used on the frame that you are hit to negate the damage.

This invincibility can be used to negate most boss mechanics, even *:!Ganavelt's Indigination, which can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/buqfQ0o5yaY); to avoid the down effect, simply have your character (or your party memebers) on auto]*.

#### Boss Infinite Down Loop

With BG related skills (such as BG gain on enemy down), and with an accessory with 4x 8% BG gain rate, you can either use or set Alphen as a support character to have him use his boost attack to down bosses. After that, due to the faster BG gain, Alphen's boost attack will be ready again once the boss gets up, allowing you to hit bosses constantly without interruption. This loop will end once the boss activates Overlimit.

Make sure to constantly attack the boss while it is down. The BG gain and hit-stop from constants attacks will make it easier for Alphen's boost attack to be ready once the boss is up.

This loop is less effective in Unknown mode due to bosses recovering from down faster.

#### Maintaining Spell casting reductions

Skills needed: Spell casting reduction for combos.

To maintain your casting time after a depleted AG bar, you can regenerate it by other means (such as normal attacks or break boosts) or by spamming dodge rolls (which maintains your reduction while slowly regenerating AG).

If you wish to go into the air while keeping your reductions, you can either use an ground-to-air arte or jump cancel a spell (while casting).

More information can be found [here](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/265989-tales-of-arise/79639361).

#### :{'media' : 'media/toa/airAttackRecovery.mp4'} Quicker air-to-ground recovery

When doing a move from the air and landing, there is a period where you are not able to do any actions. To avoid this, simply do the move closer to the ground and try to do your action (such as a dodge). The action will come out on the ground instead, making your recovery faster.

#### :{'todo' : true} Boss Boost Strike Early Kill

Also called the execution glitch. By delaying the boost strike prompt that happens when a boss hits 50% HP, you can activate it late and instantly kill the enemy. The input has to be done just before the prompt ends. You can buffer artes or normal attacks to have a better visual/audio cue to perform this technique, but the timing is still pretty strict.

Most bosses have different timing for when the boost strike prompt will disappear, so you might need different setups for different bosses.

Multi-hit boost strikes are the only ones that can cause this effect. The list of working combinations are: Law/Alphen, Kisara/Alphen and Law/Kisara.

### Control Mode Techniques

Auto-mode gives players control of the character simultaneous with the AI. While in auto mode, actions that will want to perform will be set as pending once you input a command, to make it easier for you to put commands in while not interrupting the AI. For example, the ai can dodge, do normal attacks and even artes after your actions.

This also means that if the AI is set to do nothing, auto-mode acts the same way as semi-auto mode. However, it is important to note that even if all the artes for a character are disabled, manually starting a chain while in auto may make the AI do its own pre-programmed chains on its own.

Another important feature of auto-mode is that it will automatically dodge most attacks (if possible), removes the hit-stop from your attacks and increases the speed of (some) animations by up to 25%.  You can see a showcase of these effects [here](https://twitter.com/UnheardPhantasm/status/1447392198698442754). Beware that, even if a good portion of animations is faster, the stagger time of most attacks is reduced by up to 15%. Also, if your character is air-borne the AI will not dodge under any circumstance, even if you have an air dodge available.

You can set an action as pending in memory by letting the AI control the character in auto mode then doing an action. You can also change the battle control from auto to semi-auto/manual once the AI does any action to prevent it from doing any further actions, thus saving the pending action in memory. You will notice that an action is pending when the character does not finish it animation by a slight walk away after the last action (or a quick neutral animation if sufficiently away from the enemy).

#### AI Control

As mentioned before, characters in auto-mode have pre-programmed chains that they can do on its own. These chains can be simple 2-3 arte combos or even complicated human-impossible combos.

This is because the pre-programmed chains sometimes use air artes after ground artes, or may use the wrong Flaming Edge artes (for Alphen).

You can slightly abuse this by letting the AI take control while in auto mode and continue your combo after the AI performed the impossible action. You can manipulate this further by disabling specific artes and ending your chain in different points (such as letting the AI take control in the air, after a normal chain or after an arte).

Keep in mind that some of these chains can never be seen in normal play, since the AI never finds a way to start them (such as Shionne's aerial combos). Also, if you have an action pending, the AI will continue you combo as normal and consume the pending action.

You can find more information [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHePG4uTlEI).

#### AI Cancel

With an action pending (cancel AI mid-chain): while on manual or semi-auto, you can go into your artes menu, change from arte settings to arte list (R2/L2 or R/T/left click) and select any air arte. You character will then perform that arte the closest to the ground possible, something which cannot be done while on semi-auto or manual.

*:{'media' : 'media/toa/aic.mp4'}*

If you let your character be, it will also consume any pending action and return to neutral on its own (ignoring the control mode and any strategy). This can be unwanted, since the character can have multiple actions pending. To negate this effect, simply tap (or hold) any direction after the action you chose on the menu was performed. You can also use the menu again to perform any air or ground moves on that state.

#### :{'media' : 'media/toa/bufferedcancel.mp4'} Buffered Attack Cancel

By performing artes from the arte list, you can also cancel some attacks earlier, normally during the starting frames. To do this, you simply need to have an action buffered (for example, by tapping an arte button twice) and have no AI pending actions.

Some artes may change your position before starting (such as Shionne's Gemini Aqua), which will be performed without the arte itself coming out. Others may even have their first hit connect (such as Alphen's Swallow Blade and most normal attacks).


There are a few key points to remember:

- The buffered action must be grounded. Artes that have a slight jump during its execution may not work.
- You can only cancel buffered actions by using air artes.
- You must be close enough to the enemy so that your character wouldn't start a semi-auto run.
- You can cancel the arte you choose on the menu by taking control just after your character starts the jump.
- You must be in either semi-auto or manual mode.
