First, it increases the chance your character will automatically guard against attacks (if not in a <span class=\"tagging-computed content__redirect\" data-tags=\"{&#39redirect&#39 : &#39#battle&#39}\" data-redirect=\"#battle\" data-document=\"TODPS2\" data-section=\"Tales of Destiny\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\" style=\"margin-right: 5px;\">link</span>chain</span>). For enemies, instead of guarding those attacks will hit aa <span class=\"tagging-computed content__redirect\" data-tags=\"{&#39redirect&#39 : &#39#guarding&#39}\" data-redirect=\"#guarding\" data-document=\"TODPS2\" data-section=\"Tales of Destiny\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\" style=\"margin-right: 5px;\">link</span>iron stance</span>. The second effect is that evasion decreases the chance for that character to receive critical hits.</p>\n<p><strong>Accuracy</strong> is a parameter that counter-acts evasion. Increasing accuracy decreases the chances that an attack is evaded. Additionally, accuracy also affects how much <span class=\"tagging-computed content__redirect\" data-tags=\"{&#39redirect&#39 : &#39#battle&#39}\" data-redirect=\"#battle\" data-document=\"TODPS2\" data-section=\"Tales of Destiny\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\" style=\"margin-right: 5px;\">link</span>blast</span> the enemy gains for your every attack. Your actual accuracy value changes constantly during the fight depending on your actions, which will be shown in the following sub-sections.</p>\n<p><strong>Concentration</strong> is an offensive parameter that increases the chance of performing a critical hit. Critical hits deal increased damage, restore 2 CC, can stun or apply status effects, restore your lost accuracy by 10%, and reduce enemy blast by 5%. Keep in mind that criticals have an internal cooldown before they can be done again.

There is no level requirement for using different types of lenses.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39media&#39 : &#39media/todps2/rerise.png&#39, &#39caption&#39 : &#39The re-rise menu in-game.&#39}\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"The re-rise menu in-game.\" src=\"media/todps2/rerise.png\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><u class=\"content__figure-caption\" style=\"white-space: pre;\"> The re-rise menu in-game. </u></p></p>\n</div><hr class=\"content__h3--divider\" draggable=\"false\"></div><div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"battle mechanics\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"battle\">Battle</h3><div class=\"battle\">\n<p>Actions in battle are based on the chain capacity (<em>CC</em>) system. If you have enough CC, you can perform any action freely. CC is divided into minimum and maximum CC. You begin each fight with your minimum CC value and, by doing <em>chains</em>, you increase your current maximum CC by 1. This happens until you reach your character&#39s maximum CC value; if you do any actions after that, your current maximum CC goes down to your current CC value or your minimum CC (the highest one). In any occasion, CC recovers naturally when not in a chain, at a rate of 1 CC for every 4 frames.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39media&#39 : &#39media/todps2/cc.png&#39, &#39caption&#39 : &#39The battle arena.

In the picture, the first character has a minimum CC of 8 and a maximum of 16. </u></p></p>\n<p>Doing offensive or movement actions starts a <em>chain</em>. This can affect a myriad of things, from techniques to casting time. CC will not recover naturally while in a chain. A chain will be extended by doing any other action while in one, and will only end once your character goes into a neutral stance. Once you hit 0 CC, any action that would require CC to perform will fail (even if you have bonuses that decrease that action&#39s cost to 0), making you end your chain. If you have more than 0 CC but try to perform an arte that requires more than your current amount, a normal attack will happen instead.</p>\n<p>When attacking, defeating an enemy (scales out of the combo counter), blocking (scales out of the damage received and max HP), or taking damage (scales out of the damage received and max HP) you will gain blast points. Additionally, when using an action that has invincibility (attacks do not connect and deal no damage), you will gain blast as if you would have taken damage. This blast can have different uses depending on the situation. Enemies gain blast when getting hit and this value is reduced every frame that they are attacking or casting (animation). Once enemies hit 100% blast, they will gain a small amount of invincibility and perform an attack. Enemy blast gain is also tied to your character&#39s accuracy. When doing attacks, your accuracy value is decreased slightly, and you get a further penalty for repeating the same attack multiple times (up to 7 times). All these reductions are recovered when performing a <em>charge</em> or using a different attack (in the case of the same attack penalty).</p>\n</div><hr class=\"content__h3--divider\" draggable=\"false\"></div><div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"universal-controls mechanics\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"universal-controls\">Universal Controls</h3><div class=\"universal-controls\">\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"normal-attacks\" data-open=\"normal-attacks universal-controls mechanics\">Normal Attacks</h4><div class=\"normal-attacks\">\n<p>Normal attacks are the cheapest offensive action costing only 1 CC. However, doing multiple normal attacks in the same chain will cause them to suffer a damage reduction of 10% for each attack, up to a maximum of 90% (80% on <em>DC</em>). This reduction is removed by doing an arte or spell while in the chain. Ending the chain will also reset this reduction.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"guarding\" data-open=\"guarding universal-controls mechanics\">Guarding</h4><div class=\"guarding\">\n<p>Guarding is used to reduce damage from physical attacks and to prevent being staggered. Damage is reduced by 75% when guarding on the vanilla version, but on the DC version, damage is further reduced based on difficulty. You can also perform a <em>Flash Guard</em> by guarding just before an attack hits, which reduces damage by 90% (lower than normally guarding attacks when playing the DC version at the Chaos difficulty).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th style=\"text-align:left\">Difficulty</th><th style=\"text-align:center\">Reduction</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Simple</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">75%</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Normal</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">75%</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Second</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">76%</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hard</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">80%</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Evil</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">85%</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Chaos</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">92%</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>CC also affects guarding, your current CC being the number of hits you can guard. Once your you guard the amount of CC you have, you will begin to flash red and the next attack will guard break you. Getting hit or doing any action that uses CC will restore the amount of hits you can take up to the maximum.</p>\n<p>By holding guard and tapping down you will perform a <em>charge</em>. This costs 2 CC, will guard against magical attacks, restores your lost accuracy, and makes it so that your next attack will always break your enemy&#39s guard if able.</p>\n<p>When an enemy activates evasion, or when they&#39re doing certain attacks, they gain <em>iron stance</em>. When hit at this point, a small white puff of air will appear where the attack hits. The attack will not connect and will do only 60% of the damage. Enemies can drop all iron stance after or before certain attacks, just like the player cannot activate evasion when they are attacking. Enemies may also have <em>superarmor</em>, which is similar to iron stance but cannot be broken. An iron stance that lasts a set number of hits is called penetrate. If an enemy has a penetrate value, it will be shown on screen how many hits are needed until the penetrate is broken.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"movement\" data-open=\"movement universal-controls mechanics\">Movement</h4><div class=\"movement\">\n<p>You can walk left or right with the D-Pad. Double pressing a direction or using the left stick will allow you to run, which enables you to pass through enemies. Certain enemies can push you back when you try to pass through them by blocking. You can also do the same against enemies who try to run behind you.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39media&#39 : &#39media/todps2/guardPush.mp4&#39}\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/todps2/guardPush.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p>By holding guard and pressing forward you will do an aiming dash. This will make your character dash towards the enemy, and go into the air if needed. By pressing backward instead, you will backstep. This will make your character take a step back to evade enemies&#39 attacks. Backsteps and aiming steps do not have invincibility and cost 1CC (without NG+ options). While backsteps can be done indefinitely, aiming dashes from the ground cannot be done successively without a different action in between. Additionally, if you are in a chain, you are limited to one aiming dash unless you do a backstep, touch the ground from landing, or if you are in the air. Aiming dashes and backsteps should always be done based on the direction your character is facing. This is important if you&#39re running away from an enemy or if you jump over them. If you&#39re running away from the enemy while on the ground, your backstep will instead make you stop and face the enemy. Therefore, if you wish to backstep while running away, you have the hold guard and press towards the enemy to stop and face the enemy, then hold guard and press away from the enemy to backstep.</p>\n<p>If an enemy knocks you up into the air, pressing square just as you touch the ground will perform a backstep instead of getting knocked down. This only works for attacks that launch you high enough up in the air. Attacks with a hard knockdown are unable to be recovered (your character will lay down again before getting up).</p>\n<p>Holding guard and pressing up will make you jump. This can also be done by just holding up on the left stick when in manual mode. Jumping can be used to evade enemy attacks and to cancel actions. Running before jumping will also conserve your momentum. Each jump costs 1 CC and can be done twice in succession. Doing artes, normal attacks, or touching the ground will reset this limit. After a certain height, no actions other than jumps and aiming dashes are allowed. This is due to the player character being too close to the physical ceiling of the map. Touching the physical ceiling of the maps allows you to perform <span class=\"tagging-computed content__redirect\" data-tags=\"{&#39redirect&#39 : &#39#air-walking&#39}\" data-redirect=\"#air-walking\" data-document=\"TODPS2\" data-section=\"Tales of Destiny\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\" style=\"margin-right: 5px;\">link</span>air walking</span>.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"artes-and-spells\" data-open=\"artes-and-spells universal-controls mechanics\">Artes and Spells</h4><div class=\"artes-and-spells\">\n<p>Artes and spells cost more CC than a normal attack, but they normally do more damage and have special effects. They are denoted by a sword symbol (physical artes), a flaming sword symbol (magical artes), a purple glyph (offensive spells), or a blue glyph (support spells).</p>\n<p>Spells require a certain cast time before coming out. This is divided into the casting animation and the release animation. Spells can be held and not released by holding the artes button or be canceled by tapping guard (produces the same animation as turning around when running, which has a different recovery time depending on the character). Spells <strong>cannot be canceled</strong> if done at the start of a chain in semi-auto mode (will cause them to be re-cast instead). Additionally, some spells may impose a limit on how many are present on the screen. These are usually reserved to screen-wide spells and they are limited to 4 at a time.</p>\n<p>Sucessevely cancelling spells can be an fast way to reach max CC. If you perform this after guarding however, you won&#39t gain any additional CC. Doing any attack or movement option (other than walking or running) will fix this behavior.</p>\n<p>As you use artes and spells, they gain additional effects:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>⭐  - Critical Rate is doubled. (100 times)<br>\n⭐⭐ - Accuracy reduction when using the arte is reduced by 25%. (300 times)<br>\n⭐⭐⭐ - 20% Chance of gaining back 1 CC Point if successfully hit. (600 times)<br>\n⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Increase Enemy Stagger Time by four frames. (1000 times)<br>\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - 100% Chance of gaining back 1 CC Point if successfully hit. (5000 times)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are various mechanics which impact the casting time of spells. Before a battle, you can use skills and equipment to reduce casting time. Additionally, Leon&#39s De-Earth (<em>ディアース</em>) skill also reduces the cast time of Dark Spells, and the same applies to Phillia&#39s Mental Necklace (<em>メンタルネックレス</em>). During battle, using artes and spells will reduce the casting time for spells as far as 80%. This reduction has a hardcoded limit of 31 frames. Casting time follows the formula <span class=\"tagging-katex tagging-computed\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">.</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>e</mi><mo>∗</mo><mi>α</mi></mrow><mn>10</mn></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\frac{C.Time * \\alpha}{10}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.2173em;vertical-align:-0.345em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mopen nulldelimiter\"></span><span class=\"mfrac\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8723em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.655em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:3em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">10</span></span></span></span><span style=\"top:-3.23em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:3em;\"></span><span class=\"frac-line\" style=\"border-bottom-width:0.04em;\"></span></span><span style=\"top:-3.394em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:3em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">C</span><span class=\"mord mtight\">.</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">im</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">e</span><span class=\"mbin mtight\">∗</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.0037em;\">α</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.345em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mclose nulldelimiter\"></span></span></span></span></span></span>, <span class=\"tagging-katex tagging-computed\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">.</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">C.Time</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">C</span><span class=\"mord\">.</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">im</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">e</span></span></span></span></span> being the cast time for that spell after any out-of-battle reduction and <span class=\"tagging-katex tagging-computed\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>α</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\alpha</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.0037em;\">α</span></span></span></span></span> is a variable that is increased by 1 for each arte used in the current <strong>chain</strong> and 2 for each spell.</p>\n<p>If a spell can&#39t be released due to the screen-wide spell limit, the casting time will be set to 4 frames until a spell slot opens up. Also, if you cast the same spell multiple times in succession, the second and any subsequent spells will not have any reduction in the Casting Time, however, the actual reduction will persist when casting a different spell.</p>\n<p>Examples (current applied reduction in between parentheses):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demon Fang (100%) -&ampgt; Fireball (90%)</li>\n<li>Fireball (100%) -&ampgt; Demon Fang (80%) -&ampgt; Fireball (70%)</li>\n<li>Grave (100%) -&ampgt; Normal Attack (80%) -&ampgt; Grave (80%) -&ampgt; Stone Wall (60%)</li>\n<li>Grave (100%) -&ampgt; Grave(100%) -&ampgt; Grave(100%) -&ampgt; Stone Wall (40%)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another effect that artes can have is related to healing. Healing artes will drop the healing effectiveness by 5% per use. Rutee&#39s Resurrection is the only exception since it will drop it by a total of 20%. This will continue to decrease until healing actions restore only 50% of their original value. To recover effectiveness, simply land a hit to recover 5% per hit. You can also use Rutee&#39s Search Gald and Trickster, which restores 20% effectiveness and can boost healing to up to 150%.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"blast-use\" data-open=\"blast-use universal-controls mechanics\">Blast use</h4><div class=\"blast-use\">\n<p>Once you have a full blast gauge, you can use a Blast Caliber by pressing or holding its respective button. You can also perform Blast Calibers by holding the arte and normal attack buttons. If this is done on NG+ with 2 full blast gauges and on a combo with 100+ hits, a special Blast Caliber will be performed (has a total of three versions that can be done after the previous tier is done).</p>\n<p>If your character is being continuously staggered by the enemy (more than one hit/arte) and you have 1 complete blast gauge, press L1 (just before or during a hit) to perform a Damage Break. Damage Break takes 500 Blast Points (half a gauge), gives you invincibility for 60 frames, and, on the DC version, restores your HP by 10%. This is similar to the effect that enemies have when they reach 100% blast (minus the healing). Most enemies can only do a damage break when on the ground, while the player and some specific enemies can also do it in the air.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39media&#39 : &#39media/todps2/damageBreak.mp4&#39}\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/todps2/damageBreak.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"control-modes\" data-open=\"control-modes universal-controls mechanics\">Control Modes</h4><div class=\"control-modes\">\n<p>By pressing the select button during battle, or changing it manually in the artes menu, you can change between three control types: auto, semi-auto, and manual.</p>\n<p>On auto, the default control mode for your party members, the character will act according to the strategy you have set. You cannot move characters or do any action manually other than using items, using shortcut artes from your controlled character, or requesting them to do artes or spells from the artes menu. On semi-auto mode, you can move and perform actions yourself. At the first attack of a chain (and only if you are not currently in a chain), your character will adjust their position automatically (with running and dashing). Additionally, attacks are automatically defended against if possible. This is similar to the auto-guard that happens when evasion triggers. On manual, all actions are controlled by the player.</p>\n</div></div></div><hr class=\"content__h3--divider\" draggable=\"false\"></div><div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"battle-states mechanics\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"battle-states\">Battle States</h3><div class=\"battle-states\">\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"stagger\" data-open=\"stagger battle-states mechanics\">Stagger</h4><div class=\"stagger\">\n<p>The player and enemies may be in various states during battle. The most common of these is the staggered state. If an attack hits, the enemy is staggered and is allowed to be combo&#39ed. An attack can also launch its target into the air, which will cause a slight bounce when they touch the ground. Other than the vertical launch, aerial combos and launch attacks do not have any special effects on stagger time. During a combo chain (a chain where you&#39ve previously hit the enemy), attacks cause an initial burst ( <em>chain stagger extension</em>) of stagger on startup to allow further attacks to connect better. This is around 12 frames for normal attacks and around 14 frames for artes (though some artes can have 20+ frames of chain stagger). Combo&#39ed enemies can only drop out of combos by running out of stagger, using a <span class=\"tagging-computed content__redirect\" data-tags=\"{&#39redirect&#39 : &#39#blast-use&#39}\" data-redirect=\"#blast-use\" data-document=\"TODPS2\" data-section=\"Tales of Destiny\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\" style=\"margin-right: 5px;\">link</span>damage break</span>, or by boss-specific mechanics. Combos also increase experience points. After 100 hits, the launch power of attacks becomes slightly random to make infinite combos harder.</p>\n<p>Some attacks can also also cause a knockdown. This is a state where the character is knocked into the ground and does not receive any additional stagger other than from a chain stagger extension. They will also iron stance through attacks if hit when at 10 stagger or below. A knockdown can also be caused by hitting an enemy from high enough from the ground and letting them fall. The knockdown effect, if applied on the air, can be overwritten by another status (such as a normal stagger) if it is applied before the enemy touches the ground. Some specific attacks can also cause a hard knockdown. This is the same as the normal knockdown but will not cause a bounce if done from the air. When on the ground, enemies can only take so much stagger before instantly going into a knockdown state. This happens when a chain stagger extension or <span class=\"tagging-computed content__redirect\" data-tags=\"{&#39redirect&#39 : &#39#stagger-storage&#39}\" data-redirect=\"#stagger-storage\" data-document=\"TODPS2\" data-section=\"Tales of Destiny\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\" style=\"margin-right: 5px;\">link</span>similar mechanic</span> makes the stagger value reach 50 frames.</p>\n<p>To continue combo&#39ing from a knockdown, some attacks have the off-the-ground (OTG, also called restand) property. This will cause the enemy to get back up from the knockdown state. Another unique property is the freeze effect, which will make enemies not be able to be pushed around (both in ground and air) and they will stay still during the stagger time of the attack that caused it. A freeze attack that stuns will be extended. The momentum of that attack will also be applied once the effect ends.</p>\n<p>Some enemies cannot get knocked down. While this doesn&#39t affect stagger time directly, they still gain the knockdown effects (and thus won&#39t gain stagger from connecting attacks) if they would be knockdown due to high stagger (&ampgt;50 frames). This can make enemies feel like they&#39re resisting stagger when in fact they&#39re being treated as knockdown&#39ed. While there are no visual cues to this effect, doing an OTG attack will also clear the knockdown effect as it would do normally.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39media&#39 : &#39media/todps2/staggerKnock.mp4&#39, &#39caption&#39 : &#39Example of an enemy that normally cannot get knocked-down, but does due to high stagger.&#39}\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/todps2/staggerKnock.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video><u class=\"content__figure-caption\" style=\"white-space: pre;\"> Example of an enemy that normally cannot get knocked-down, but does due to high stagger. </u></p></p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"status-ailments-and-stun\" data-open=\"status-ailments-and-stun battle-states mechanics\">Status Ailments and Stun</h4><div class=\"status-ailments-and-stun\">\n<p>Critical hits are tied to status ailments and stuns. Universally, they amplify the stagger value of the attack that caused it and cause a knockdown. For status ailments, they have various effects and disable the use of Blast Calibers. Different status ailments have different durations and cooldowns, which can cause you to perform less critical hits. If a status ailment is not applied, the enemy will be stunned. Stuns causes a different staggered state (with its own duration), the next hit while the enemy is stunned also receives bonus stagger time. When the enemy is stunned, all attacks OTG (including the hit that caused the stun, which means that attacks that knockdown will not if they cause a stun). Stunned airborne enemies that touch the ground can still get knocked down. Stun duration may be modified by equipment, however, spells that cause a force stun will ignore those modifiers (and possibly even reduce the duration if the enemy is already stunned). Additionally, each enemy has a definitive strike chain, which is a set combo that will stun the enemy and increase the drop rate in that battle to 100% (or double it in successive encounters).</p>\n<p>A special status is the stop effect. This is caused by specific artes and the hourglass item. During stop, the enemy will stay still until the stop effect ends. Stun duration keeps counting down during stop.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"elemental-advantages\" data-open=\"elemental-advantages battle-states mechanics\">Elemental Advantages</h4><div class=\"elemental-advantages\">\n<p>There are 10 elements in the game: Slash, Strike, Pierce, Sound, Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, Light, and Dark. Swordians and equipment may also have an attribute. These only affect normal attacks and specific artes.</p>\n<p>Elements are divided into offensive (applying elemental effects) and defensive attributes. Defensive attributes are further divided into resistances and weaknesses. Attacking a resisted element will do reduced damage, increase the chance of evasion (hit rate and critical rate are reduced to 1/4), and reduce the stagger duration for that attack by 2 frames. Weakness gives increased damage, increased accuracy, increased critical rate, and increased stagger time by 2 frames. Attacking both a weakness and a resistance at the same time will result in a normal hit. Additionally, if the same attack hits more resistances than weaknesses, the attack will be considered a resisted attack.

This needs to be high enough from the ground so that touching it will cause the animation of the attack to cancel. This costs 1 CC and reduces the landing recovery from 42 frames to 25, resulting in you recovering faster and having more CC available for use (+3 CC by the time the other recovery animation would be ending). <span class=\"tagging-computed content__redirect\" data-tags=\"{&#39reference&#39 : true}\" data-redirect=\"#references\" data-document=\"TODPS2\" data-section=\"Tales of Destiny\">1</span></li>\n<li>The second is using a spell and instantly canceling it with a guard. The spell needs to be done just before touching the ground, while you&#39re still in the air. Your character will proceed to lock to the ground to perform the spell, where you can then cancel it. This method also reduces the recovery to 25 frames, however, it costs at least 2 CC (causing you to have only +2 CC than not using it) and it is harder to perform. Can be useful for cases where you do not want your normal attack to hit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For falls with horizontal momentum, the recovery time will be 25 frames, and using one of the techniques above will not reduce it.</p>\n<p>Having a faster landing recovery can also be useful to reset the properties of your normal attack.</p>\n<p>Another recovery that can be beneficial to cancel is the release of spells. These usually take 72 frames to start recovering CC, but can be canceled earlier. By chaining the spell with another and then instantly canceling it, you can reduce the recovery to 42 frames (+5 CC). You can also use an aiming dash or backstep if you have only 1 CC left since those still recover faster than waiting for the spell release animation.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><span class=\"tagging tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39versions&#39 : &#39Vanilla&#39}\"><h4 id=\"cc-recovery-glitch\" data-open=\"cc-recovery-glitch cc-related-techniques techniques\">CC Recovery Glitch</h4> <span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\" style=\"margin-right: 15px; cursor: help; filter: brightness(1.5); color: rgb(248, 217, 89);\" data-tte-version-trigger=\"\" data-tte-tooltip-text=\"Version: Vanilla.\">devices</span></span><div class=\"cc-recovery-glitch\">\n<p>Another way to increase your maximum CC is to manipulate the end of a chain.

Any ground action that you do while not being in a chain or after other unique actions such as landing from a jump, backstepping, aiming dashes, and charging, will start a running animation (the semi-auto run that is present in most entries on the franchise). This is because, while in semi-auto mode, actions that would whiff if done where you are will be buffered and make your character run instead. This semi-auto run will end depending on the distance (between you and the enemy) that is necessary for the buffered action to \"connect\".</p>\n<p>Once your character gets close enough, the buffered action will be used and the buffer is cleared. You can cancel the semi-auto run animation by either jumping, doing an aiming dash, or stopping (by doing the input for a backstep). Both jumping and stopping will also clear your buffered action.</p>\n<p>Two properties of semi-auto can be exploited to do advanced techniques. They are the two spatial properties: the current distance between you and the enemy and the distance necessary for your action to be performed (after the semi-auto run); and the action buffer.</p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances, you cannot have an action buffered if you&#39re not in the semi-auto run state. However, if you run away from the enemy and perform a normal attack or arte that requires your character to be closer to the enemy, your character will first do an animation to stop and turn around. This action, which will be called the <em>forced neutral animation</em>, is one of the only periods where you can perform another action while you still have a buffered action.</p>\n<p>In short, any action you do while running away from the enemy will initiate a <em>forced neutral animation</em> and be buffered. This animation can then be canceled in any other action which will come out on the spot. After the action is finished, your character will once again return to neutral and start the semi-auto run to perform his buffered action.</p>\n<p>The three key points to that behavior are the <strong>buffered action</strong>, the <strong>forced neutral animation</strong>, and the <strong>forced action</strong> (the action that is used to cancel the <em>forced neutral animation</em>). This, however, is still nothing that couldn&#39t have been done in manual mode. That is where the spatial properties come into play. During the <em>forced action</em>, if your character comes close enough to the enemy to the point where you wouldn&#39t need the semi-auto run, your <em>forced action</em> will instantly be canceled and the <em>buffered action</em> will come out.</p>\n<p>This is called a Spatial-buffer cancel (SB Cancel). The cancel can even mess up your momentum and your character&#39s state (such as color).</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39media&#39 : &#39media/todps2/sbCancel.mp4&#39}\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/todps2/sbCancel.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p>There are other important points to SB Canceling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you go airborne during your <em>forced action</em>, keep in mind that air-enabled actions have different spatial properties for air and ground (this depends both on the <em>forced action</em> and the <em>buffered action</em>). If your <em>buffered action</em> does not come out, it will be cleared due to the semi-auto rules mentioned above. If your chain does not work because of spatial properties, you can consider using a normal attack as the <em>buffered action</em>, since the air version of it does not need spatial considerations to come off (works on any distance). You can then chain your preferred action to the normal attack, while still canceling the <em>forced action</em>. You should also take into consideration that various artes may not look like they leave the ground, such as Leon&#39s Dragon Swarm, but they will consume any air-enabled <em>buffered action</em> or clear the buffer during its execution.</li>\n<li>If the <em>forced action</em> you used was using an artes button (o/x), the <em>buffered action</em> will be overwritten to be the same as the <em>forced action</em> you just used. If the <em>forced action</em> you used was using a shortcut (L2/R2), your <em>buffered action</em> will stay the same.</li>\n<li>Airborne enemies change the spatial properties required for your <em>buffered action</em> to come out.

Additionally, if casting a spell on semi-auto, changing your control mode to manual will still have that spell buffered, which can help with SB Storage.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the spell ends in the air and if the <em>buffered action</em> is air-enabled, the moment your character leaves the ground the animation will be canceled and the air action will come out.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39media&#39 : &#39media/todps2/demonLanceCancel.mp4&#39}\">For example, Leon can use Dragon Swarm just after the jump from Demon Lance, making the lance follow Leon while Dragon Swarm is in effect.</span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/todps2/demonLanceCancel.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"sb-storage\" data-open=\"sb-storage spatial-buffer-cancel techniques\">SB storage</h4><div class=\"sb-storage\">\n<p>By changing to Manual during the <em>forced neutral animation</em> (or during casting for spells and 1 frame after pressing the artes button for screen-wide artes), the <em>buffered action</em> will be saved in memory but will not be consumed.

For example, SB canceling a grab arte (from Kongman or Stahn) will make it so that the enemy will get stuck to that character until your chain ends (which can be prolonged indefinitely by holding a spell with Stanh and doing backsteps with Kongman with the <em>Free Movement</em> option from NG+).</p>\n</div></div></div><hr class=\"content__h3--divider\" draggable=\"false\"></div><div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"transition-glitch techniques\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"transition-glitch\">Transition Glitch</h3><div class=\"transition-glitch\">\n<p>Spells in this game work in a certain way. First, when starting to cast a spell, information related to that spell is loaded into memory. Then, after a certain amount of time (casting time) and if the screen allows it (for screen-wide spells), the spell comes out. At this point, new effects may be loaded into memory, such as graphical elements or other animations. These are called successively until the spell is finished. Some effects, however, have windows on their transitions where one can overwrite their behavior, which is the basis of the transition glitch.</p>\n<p>This takes into consideration the following aspects: the characteristics of the effect/spell currently on screen, if the spell was already loaded in memory (requires you to start the casting animation at any point during the battle -- it is not required that you complete the cast), and if that effect was generated normally or due to another transition glitch. If done correctly, you can create a spell that is not correctly handled by the game, allowing further glitchy effects. There are two known ways to create a \"stale\" effect to perform the transition glith: using the Fearful Flare spell and the Surviving Hollin Blast Caliber.</p>\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><span class=\"tagging tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39media&#39 : &#39media/todps2/transitionFearful.mp4&#39}\"><h4 id=\"fearful-flare\" data-open=\"fearful-flare transition-glitch techniques\">Fearful Flare</h4> </span><div class=\"fearful-flare\"><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/todps2/transitionFearful.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p>\n<p>The last fireball from the Fearful Flare spell has a stale animation that can be abused by a transition glitch. First, load the spell you want to perform in the place of the last fireball in memory by casting it (can be canceled by guarding, just starting the chant works). This spell will be loaded in memory until the end of the battle. Then, cast Fearful Flare and start casting your loaded spell just as the last fireball (fifth hit) of Fearful Flare is on screen. You do not need to finish casting the spell for the glitch to work. Based on the spell loaded (some may result in no effects or just graphical artifacts), a glitchy animation will play out. If the spell does damage, that damage will also use the same multiplier as Fearful Flare.</p>\n<p>While only Stahn and Phillia have access to Fearful Flare, other characters can still perform step 3. You can also perform this glitch when the enemy uses Fearful Flare on your team. This may result in different effects than casting Fearful Flare on your own.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"content__h4\"><h4 id=\"surviving-hollin\" data-open=\"surviving-hollin transition-glitch techniques\">Surviving Hollin</h4><div class=\"surviving-hollin\">\n<p>The last laser of Surviving Hollin also has a stale animation. The principle behind it works the same way as the Fearful Flare variation. Load a spell, do Surviving Hollin, then cast the loaded spell just as the final laser is on-screen. This results in different effects from the fireball from Fearful Flare.</p>\n<p><span class=\"tagging-text tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39media&#39 : &#39media/todps2/transition.mp4&#39}\"></span><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/todps2/transition.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p></p>\n<p>In the video, the final laser is canceled by Dark Hole. This creates a persistent graphical artifact that can be used to perform other transitions easily. At this point, every animation not tied to a character can be manipulated by a Transition Glitch, enabling further effects not tied to Fearful Flare or Survivin Hollin. An animation is then canceled to Holy Lance which is quickly canceled into Explode, glitching the background and creating multiple instances of it. This is then canceled to Piko Piko Hammer, Stone Wall, and Indignation.</p>\n<p>Various effects can be created using transition glitches. However, keep in mind some may exhaust the number of loaded animations in memory (causing no more projectiles or spell effects to happen for the rest of the battle) or crash the game.</p>\n</div></div></div></div>"},{"id":"glitches","name":"Glitches","color":"teal","content":"\n<p>This section contains a discussion on useful glitches and exploits that can be used outside of battle.</p>\n<div class=\"content__h3\"><button class=\"content__collapse\" data-open=\"out-of-bounds-and-sequence-breaks glitches\"><span class=\"material-symbols-rounded\">expand_circle_up</span></button><h3 id=\"out-of-bounds-and-sequence-breaks\">Out-of-Bounds and Sequence Breaks</h3><div class=\"out-of-bounds-and-sequence-breaks\">\n<div class=\"content__h4\"><span class=\"tagging tagging-computed\" data-tags=\"{&#39media&#39 : &#39media/todps2/caveQueen.mp4&#39}\"><h4 id=\"skip-cave-queen\" data-open=\"skip-cave-queen out-of-bounds-and-sequence-breaks glitches\">Skip Cave Queen</h4> </span><div class=\"skip-cave-queen\"><p style=\"opacity: 1; text-align: center;\"><video preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" draggable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"order: 2; width: 80%; height: auto; max-width: 640px; outline: none; border-radius: 14px;\"><source src=\"media/todps2/caveQueen.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p>\n<p>By walking on the side of a ledge on the screen where the Cave Queen boss battle starts, you can skip it and get to Moreau earlier than intended.
