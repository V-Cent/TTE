## Table of Contents

## Base Mechanics

Here will be displayed a simple description of the base mechanics of the game. Most of these are already explained during gameplay, but may have some effects that were only found out during experimentation.

Special thanks to the [atwiki community](https://w.atwiki.jp/vesperia/) and users [Miraclechao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKdSnZqTX5w), [Passaro](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSeHNaASeaUq3Fv5l6-9fwNF9PoRR9LeP) and [Muragiri](https://muragiri.hatenadiary.org/archive/category/%E3%82%82%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8%E6%A5%BD%E3%81%97%E3%82%80%20TOV).

### Stats

Each character 8 stats separated into two different categories:

- Physical Attack(_Phy.Atk_) --> Physical Damage increase.
- Physical Defense(_Phy.Def_) --> Physical Damage inflicted decrease.
- Magic Attack(_Mag.Atk_) --> Magic Damage dealt increase.
- Magic Defense(_Mag.Def_) --> Magic Damage inflicted decrease.
- Agility(_Agi_) - Increase Critical Rate and Movement Speed.
- Luck(_Luck_) - Increases chance to produce beneficial random effects and drop chance.

All defenses increase the chance to trigger solid stance.

Definitions:

**Solid Stance**: Attack does no stagger (but still does damage). A small blue bubble appear on the receptor of the attack. Enemy may drop all solid stance after or before certain attacks. To break solid stance, use artes that have the guard break property or do enough damage (not based on stat values) to break through the defense.

### Basic Arte Progression

This battle system works like most TP-based battle systems of the series. The player can link normal attacks into artes to prolong the combo chain. A normal arte can be followed by either an altered arte or an arcane arte. An altered arte can be followed by an arcane arte. Arcanes cannot be followed by other artes. Also, normal attacks can be followed by a free-run attack (Free-run + normal attack). This results into a chain progression like this:

Normal Attack (x3) --> Free-run Attack --> Base Arte --> Altered Arte --> Arcane Arte

Other skills in the game can change the number of normal attacks and artes you can use before your normal progression ends. There are also skills that can change the limitations on altered and arcane artes, making them be followed by any other arte.

One important thing to note is that, if you are able to do two artes of the same tier in succession, you cannot use the same one without a different arte in between(e.g. Azure Edge into Azure Edge).

Fatal Strikes (**FS**), when unlocked, can also be used by pressing the FS button (default as right trigger) when the FS symbol appears on screen.

FS, Burst Artes and Overlimit can be performed in any part of the chain when applicable.

### Overlimit and Burst Artes

Overlimit is a mechanic where you can consume the overlimit bar for special effects. The most import one is that you do not have any limitations on your progression, being able to chain normals and artes in a free-form way. During overlimit you can also use Burst Artes by holding the artes button after an altered or arcane arte. The Burst Arte you use depends on certain skills your character has enabled.

Overlimit also has special effects depending on the level of overlimit used (higher levels also have the effects of lower ones):

- Lv.1: No special effects.
- Lv.2: All attacks OTG and deal increased damage to downed enemies.
- Lv.3: No TP is consumed for using artes. Mystic artes are enabled for use by holding the normal attack button after an arcane arte or burst arte.
- Lv.4: Characters will be invincible from enemies attack. Be careful since you (and enemies) can still be stunned!

### Other information

**Ground Hit Limit**

There is a limit to 9 hits to downed enemies before they ignore any further hits when downed.

**Down Hit Mechanics**

There are different types of down states, and each has different characteristics:

Ground down

- Normal downed state.
- The enemy will start an animation to get up after a certain period. During the initial frames of this animation (even before the enemy starts to get up) the enemy can be hit by most attacks.
- OTG attacks can hit through most of the ground down state, and will instantly put the staggered enemy back on its feet.
- If you hit the enemy with an attack that launches upward, it will transition to the "Aerial Down" state.
- Any other attack which does not launch will stagger and the enemy will drop to the "Ground down" state again.

Aerial down

- Most attacks will hit without needing specific timing like ground down. They will also juggle a slight bit.
- Once down to the ground, the enemy will do a slight bounce and transition to the "Ground down" state.

Definitions:

**OTG**: OTG, or off-the-ground attacks, are flags that certain attacks (or part of attacks) have that make the enemy transition from a downed to a standing state when hit. They can be useful to continue the normal combo progression after a knockdown arte or spell.

**Spell Casting Time Mechanics**

Spells need casting time before they can come out. There are ways however, to reduce this time. They are:

Accessories:

- Mystic Mark: 15% reduction.
- Mystic Symbol: 25% reduction.
- Shizel's Necklace: 50% reduction (Rita only).

Skills:

- Speed Spell: 30% reduction.
- Light Magic: 40% reduction.
- Rhythm: Up to 50%.

Chains:

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true}"}
- 8% per arte in the chain (persists through manual cancelling).
:::

All these reduction only affect artes will only work up to certain amount, just like other game in the series.

With Rita, being in the air automatically cancels the special animation of advanced spells. Spell casting is also faster overall by about 18 frames (not counting the time saved by the animation of advanced spells).

## Glitches

In this section, we have a group of glitches and a small description on how to replicate/explain them. In this section, you will not find glitches that are currently useful for Combat, this is found on the next segment.

### Equipment/Items/Accessories Glitches

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true, 'versions' : 'Definitive'}"}
#### Winged Boots Glitch
:::

On the new Definitive Edition, the Winged Boots slightly decrease your run speed when synthesized. Therefore, it is faster to not get the Winged Boots during the game.

### Out of Bounds and Sequence Breaks

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true}"}
#### Tutorials Skip
:::

If you enter a tutorial battle with a character other than Yuri with the skill "Stand alone", the tutorial will not occur and it will be a normal battle.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true, 'versions' : 'Vanilla'}"}
#### Raven & Estelle Recruit
:::

PS. This glitch requires you to progress the Dark Enforcer side quest up until you learn Shining Eagle.

During the part where Raven and Estelle leave the party you can:

- Talk to Flynn in the current Yormgen and go to Mantaic.
- Go to the oasis and talk to the man sitting down by the two children for a scene.
- Rest at Mantaic's inn. Go toward the oasis again for a scene.

Raven and Estelle and now in your party.

### Minor Battle Glitches

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true, 'versions' : 'Vanilla'}"}
#### Hourglass Fatal Strikes
:::

If you hourglass an enemy with the FS symbol active, you can do them any number of times until the Hourglass effect ends.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'versions' : 'Vanilla'}"}
#### Infinite Invincibility
:::

Have the Eternal Support skill equipped on Estelle, and then have her cast Force Field over and over. If Eternal Support activates, whoever received the Force Field will become invincible for the rest of the battle.

## Combat Techniques

### General Techniques

:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tov/spellCancel.mp4'}"}
#### Spell Cancel
:::

Instead of using free-run to cancel the recovery of attacks, you can use a spell then instantly cancel it for the same effect. This is usually faster than FRC but harder to perform. A perfect spell cancel will give control back to the user after 15 frames.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true}"}
#### Spell Chant Reduction
:::

Character specific: Rita.
Skill Needed: Spell Charge (1,2,3)

When using spells with Rita, you can hold the spell button (or hold the artes button before using R-stick shortcuts) to hold the spell, and press it again as soon as it is ready. This will remove the extra animation that the advanced spells have, making them come out a little faster. This is only needed when grounded.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true, 'versions' : 'Vanilla'}"}
#### Spells with any character
:::

On the artes screen, select and arte with the cursor and switch characters at the same time as pressing A. The switched character will be able to perform the spell (the screen will return to the original character when pressing A).

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true, 'versions' : 'PS3'}"}
#### Infinite Overlimit
:::

Skills required: Burst hold.

While an enemy boss is in overlimit, if you manage to use a burst arte at the end of your own overlimit and the boss performs an M.A., you will have infinite overlimit after the M.A. ends.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true, 'media' : 'media/tov/atgc.mp4'}"}
#### Air to Ground Cancel (AtGC)
:::

Do an aerial-enabled arte close to the ground for possible effects. These include: lingering hit-boxes, visual effects or cancelled animations.
For example, most aerial-enabled altered artes can produce the shine animation without the actual attack coming out.
The window for activation is around 6 frames before landing, different frames possibly producing different effects.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true}"}
It is also possible to cancel the landing animation and do an arte as soon as touching the ground. (may require diagonal jumps? air attacks? frame perfect?)
:::

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true, 'media' : 'media/tov/tauntCancel.mp4'}"}
#### Taunt Cancel
:::

(How to set Raven as first in party while having him on auto?)

Skills needed: Bark.

Repede has a skill that makes his taunt have a chance (~33%) to cancel everything on the screen. Use this to cancel burst artes, fatal strikes and everything else.

There are a few ways to use this consistently.

The first is to have a second controller, and do the taunt with Repede yourself. Pausing and un-pausing can also improve consistency when using two controllers alone (and does not make the camera move around).

The second is to have Raven in the party. During the action you want to cancel, pause and change to Raven. While in the menu, use your personal strategy (character specific down strategy), pause and un-pause, change back to your character and change to the strategy back to the one you want to use. This is more consistent than using Repede to taunt yourself, since you would have wait a couple of frames to make sure the taunt will come out.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true, 'versions' : 'PS3'}"}
#### Fake Fatal Strikes
:::

(is an arte required so that you can activate the FS during the fail state?)

On normal enemies, it is possible to make Fatal Strikes not instantly kill by mashing the Fatal Strike button, starting to mash just before the Fatal Strike late fail state (i.e. the time where, if you press the fatal strike button, the symbol grows and disappears, without an attack coming out). Doing this on a boss makes so that the FS gauge does not recover and that no bonuses for FS are applied (for the current FS).

Requires Turbo controller for consistency.

More information [here](https://muragiri.hatenadiary.org/entry/20100322/p1).


:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tov/fakeGuardArte.mp4'}"}
#### Fake Guard Artes
:::

Skills needed: Guard artes.

In semi-auto mode, guarding then doing a base arte from a distance makes you run to the enemy, however the invincibility effect happens as soon as you begin to run. Cancelling the running animation in a guard makes you use the invincibility without using an arte.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tov/manualCancel.mp4', 'forcedvideo' : true}"}
### Manual/Free-run Cancel (FRC)
:::

Manual/Free-run cancel is a basic battle technique where you can cancel the recovery frames of attacks. This technique can be used in all characters in the PS3 version (while in manual mode), while in the vanilla only Repede can use it with a skill.

For the Repede skill, it enables the user to use Manual/Free-run cancel in any direction (360 degrees) and also use it in semi-auto mode.

#### Manual/Free-run Cancel Basics

After an arte you can free run to the direction of the arte to start a free-run as soon as you can cancel the arte. This is useful to avoid punish for attacks that are negative on hit, such as Azure Edge.

You can then cancel the free-run into a guard/magic guard to quickly go back to neutral and be able to do another arte or normal as fast as possible.

Below are variations of the FRC that can be useful in different scenarios. Keep in mind that if you guard while moving it takes 24 frames for your character to go back to neutral. Magic guard only takes 14 frames to recover when moving. Both take 14 frames to recover when standing still (or below a certain x velocity).

#### Empty FRC

Quickly tap Free-run then completely stop, your character will reach the neutral state on its own. This is slower than a normal Manual Cancel but does not require you to press guard.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tov/mgfrc.mp4'}"}
#### Magic Guard FRC
:::

Quickly press Free-run and do a reverse fireball motion (forward --> forward-down --> down) for the magic guard to come out. You can also go straight from forward to down if possible (strict input). After that release guard and wait for the neutral state

#### Corner FRC

Quickly press Free-run slightly towards the arena perimeter or towards a big enemy. Your character should not have any horizontal movement if successful. After that guard and wait for the neutral state.

Sometimes, there is a frame advantage on delaying the guard slightly in order to make your guard recover faster. The slowest setup is quickly tapping free-run as soon as you can cancel the current arte. This will result in a cancel of ~22 frames, slightly faster than the normal FRC.

#### Guard Cancel FRC

Skills needed: Guard artes, Ability Plus.

Do the normal FRC inputs but, as soon as you start the guard animation, input a base arte (this requires). The base arte will cancel the guard. This will not reset your arte progression, it will just cancel out of guard faster, thus its uses are limited.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true}"}
#### Frame data
:::

Heres some frame data about the manual/free-run cancel and its variations (keep in mind that a magic guard is about 10 frames faster than a normal guard):

From slowest to fastest (FR = Free run animation), considering perfect inputs:

- Empty FRC: 25+ frames until next action. (25+)
- FRC: 1(FR) + 24 frames until next action. (25)
- Magic Guard FRC = 2(FR) + 14 frames until next action. (16)
- Corner FRC = 1(FR) + 14 frames until next action. (15)
- Guard Cancel = 1(FR) + 6 frames until base arte starts. (7)

### Boss Behavior Manipulation

Bosses do not function like normal enemies. Without manipulating them, they can apparently drop out of your combo and punish you, even while they the stagger values would not allow them too. To combat that, here are some techniques that can help you combo bosses:

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true}"}
#### Recovery Attack baiting
:::

Letting the enemy do their chain before you start your combo (punishing the enemy at the end of their combo) or punishing their recovery attacks in a safely manner (e.g. using knockdowns mid-combo and expecting them to use an arte) can make so that you can perform your combos "mostly" uninterrupted.

The number of attacks a boss can use is unique to each boss (though they are usually the same as the player).

For example, punishing a normal -> base -> arcane chain will more than likely work for most bosses. Punishing 2-3 of their recovery attacks will also work the same way.

#### Stun lock

Stunning an enemy after a punish (recovery attack or arte chain) makes so that there is no way for the enemy to do a recovery attack during your combo, so watch out for stuns mid combo. If you did not bait recovery attacks, you may need to do it once mid-combo for the stun lock to have effect.

#### Boss Documented Behavior

There are certain behavior that are unique to bosses also:

- Recover Breakout: Knocking a boss down may make the boss do a flip (recover) and stay on the standing state, instead of being knocked down.
- Stat Breakout: Due to defenses, a boss may be able to solid stance through your attacks (even after you break their guard). This effect is not that common, and only certain bosses may have enough defenses to solid stance through your initial attacks.
- Recovery Attack Breakout: If able, the boss can do a recovery attack mid-combo. This also resets the staggered status (but does not drop your current combo chain), so a stat breakout may occur if you hit them in frames that they are not vulnerable.

Therefore, to properly combo a boss without ever being punished you need: good offensive stats to not trigger solid stance during the combo, baiting recovery attacks or an arte chain and, finally, a stun lock.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tov/sac.mp4', 'forcedvideo' : true}"}
### Semi-auto/Stick Cancel (SAC)
:::

Semi-auto cancel is a technique that abuses the free-run animation that happens when you use semi-auto, and the buffered actions of auto mode.

Using SAC's cancels any sort of casting bonuses and resets actions that can only be done 1 per chain (such as Judith's dash and guard artes).

SAC can be set-up mid combo, and it does not require neutral stance/guard to be in effect.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'todo' : true}"}
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JppXEzTMQyc (? Variation of Spell SAC?)
(Also, apparently there are two variations of SAC that can be done on XBOX. Easier to do too.)
:::

#### Semi-auto/Stick Cancel Basics

While in any action (free-run, guard, jump or arte) go to the menu and buffer an arte by selecting it while in auto mode (in the character that you're controlling), then, while in battle, change back to semi-auto mode (manual can be used in limited scenarios). The arte you selected in auto mode is now buffered and the game will make you run to the enemy to use it every time it is possible.

While this arte is buffered, you can, while in a combo, perform another arte that requires you to run to the target (due to the semi-auto mechanics) to instantly cancel you to neutral and start the buffered arte (thus starting another semi-auto run). If you perform another action before the buffered action is completed, you successfully used a Semi-auto cancel to reset your arte progression and use an action when your not supposed to.

For example, with Yuri:

Set auto buffered arte as Draconian Slash.

Free-run to the enemy and do Azure Storm. Cancel Azure Storm into Severing Fang. This will start the free-run animation, and instantly cancel it into another free-run animation that will perform Draconian Slash if you let it. Instead of that, do another Azure Storm just after inputting Severing Fang. This will cause Yuri to do Azure Storm followed to Azure Storm, something that is not possibly normally.

For all further examples, artes set on auto (in this example Draconian Slash) are called **buffered artes**. Artes used for the cancel are called (in this example Severing Fang) are called **cancel artes**.

For better effect, both buffered artes and cancel artes need to be artes that require your character to be very close to the enemy to perform. The enemy dimensions can also be important, since there are occasions where the character will be stuck in the free-run animation without the arte coming out.

Keep in mind that you can also cancel to normals instead of artes.

#### Spell SAC

If you use a spell as the cancel arte, the SAC instantly cancels it, allowing you to chain any arte as fast as possible with no distance restriction. This helps in occasions where the cancel arte can come one by mistake due to the distance between you and the enemy.

This variation can also be done on manual monde.

In semi-auto, if you mash spells while moving they will be instantly cancelled into movement again, resulting in some interesting visual effects.

#### Walk SAC

If you use the left-stick as the main form of movement, and hold the walk angle (slight movement on the L-Stick), any movement due to the semi-auto run will be a walk instead, increasing the consistency of the technique.

You can also hold the walk angle away from the enemy, causing the user to do a quick turn around, giving you even more time to perform the cancel.

Finally, you can always cancel the semi-auto run into a free-run, preventing any sort of arte to come out and easily chaining into your own arte or free-run attack.

#### SAC consume

An even easier way to perform SAC's is to set the buffered arte as the arte you want to use instead. This way, the cancel arte is the only one which requires the distance to be strict. The objective is to do your combo, use your cancel arte and then do nothing and wait for the buffered arte to come out.

If you want, you can then pause and set up a new buffered arte to use another SAC consume, mid-combo.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tov/pushGuardChain.mp4'}"}
#### Push Guard Chain
:::

Skills needed: Guard artes.

If your cancel arte is a base arte, you can use it to cancel push guards, making it possible to chain them until your close enough to perform your buffered arte. This can be a very fast way to move forward, especially with characters like Raven.

:::tagging{data-tags="{'media' : 'media/tov/fakeGuardArteChaining.mp4', 'forcedvideo' : true}"}
#### Fake Guard Arte Chaining
:::

Skills needed: Guard artes.

With semi-auto cancel, as it removes guard delay, you can chain fake guard artes in place instead of needing to run a bit. The invincibility effect stacks, so chaining a lot of fake guard artes can make you invincible for tens of seconds (with only about 2 seconds of mashing). Using a magic guard (with the cancel base arte set as down) can make you perform the chains even faster, making you invincible for multiple seconds and even minutes.
