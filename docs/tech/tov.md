## Base Mechanics

Here will be displayed a simple description of the base mechanics of the game. Most of these are already explained during gameplay, but may have some effects that were only found out during experimentation.

### Stats

Each character has 6 stats:

- Physical Attack(_Phy.Atk_) → Physical Damage increase.
- Physical Defense(_Phy.Def_) → Physical Damage inflicted decrease.
- Magic Attack(_Mag.Atk_) → Magic Damage dealt increase.
- Magic Defense(_Mag.Def_) → Magic Damage inflicted decrease.
- Agility(_Agi_) → Increase Critical Rate and Movement Speed.
- Luck(_Luck_) → Increases chance to produce beneficial random effects and drop chance.

All defenses increase the chance to trigger solid stance.

Definitions:

**Solid Stance**: Attack does no stagger (but still does damage). A small blue bubble appear on the receptor of the attack. Enemy may drop all solid stance after or before certain attacks. To break solid stance, use artes that have the guard break property or do enough damage (not based on stat values) to break through the defense.

### Basic Arte Progression

This battle system works like most TP-based battle systems of the series. The player can link normal attacks into artes to prolong the combo chain. A normal arte can be followed by either an altered arte or an arcane arte. An altered arte can be followed by an arcane arte. Arcanes cannot be followed by other artes. Also, normal attacks can be followed by a free-run attack (Free-run + normal attack). This results into a chain progression like this:

Normal Attack (x3) → Free-run Attack → Base Arte → Altered Arte → Arcane Arte

Other skills in the game can change the number of normal attacks and artes you can use before your normal progression ends. There are also skills that can change the limitations on altered and arcane artes, making them be followed by any other arte.

One important thing to note is that, if you are able to do two artes of the same tier in succession, you cannot use the same one without a different arte in between(e.g. Azure Edge into Azure Edge).

Fatal Strikes (**FS**), when unlocked, can also be used by pressing the FS button (default as right trigger) when the FS symbol appears on screen after an arte. Pressing the button too early or too late will cause the current FS symbol disappear, making you to do another arte to try again.

FS, Burst Artes and Overlimit can be performed in any part of the chain when applicable.

### Overlimit and Burst Artes

Overlimit is a mechanic where you can consume the overlimit bar for special effects. The most import effect is that you do not have any limitations on your arte progression, being able to chain normals and any artes in a free-form way. During overlimit you can also use Burst Artes by holding the artes button after an altered or arcane arte. The Burst Arte you use depends on certain skills your character has enabled.

Overlimit has special effects depending on the level of overlimit used (higher levels also have the effects of lower ones):

- Lv.1: No special effects.
- Lv.2: All attacks OTG and deal increased damage to downed enemies.
- Lv.3: No TP is consumed for using artes. Mystic artes are enabled for use by holding the normal attack button after an arcane arte or burst arte.
- Lv.4: Characters will be invincible from enemies attack. Be careful since you (and enemies) can still be stunned!

Keep in mind that some of your opponents can also have Overlimit! They gain it throughout the fight based on the same rules of the player, and, depending on the enemy, you can even hear the sound effect for each individual OVL bar the enemy gains.

**OVL activation hit effects**

The overlimit activation hit also has different effects depending on the character you are using. These usually influence the vertical launch power or the pushback of the overlimit hit. The effects are the following:

- **Yuri**: Very small launch and small pushback. Enemy is put in a downed state.
- **Estelle**: Medium launch and small pushback. Enemy is put in a spinning state for 70 frames. OTGs (doesn't cause the spinning state if enemy is down, stagger time does not change).
- **Repede**: No launch and no pushback. Enemy is put in a spinning state for 90 frames. OTGs (doesn't cause the spinning state if enemy is down, stagger time does not change).
- **Karol**: No launch and very small pushback. Enemy is put in a downed state.
- **Rita**: Medium launch and small pushback. Enemy is put in a downed state.
- **Raven**: No launch and medium pushback. Does not knockdown the enemy (staggers for about 60 frames). OTGs.
- **Judith**: Very high launch and medium pushback. Enemy is put in a downed state.
- **Patty**: Depends on Patty's current form.
> - Normal Form: High launch and medium pushback. Enemy is put in a downed state.
> - Advance Form: Small launch and small pushback. Enemy is put in a downed state.
> - Brainiac Form: No launch and very high pushback. Enemy is put in a downed state.
> - Critical Form: Medium launch and small pushback. Enemy is put in a spinning state for 90 frames. OTGs (doesn't cause the spinning state if enemy is down, stagger time does not change).
- **Flynn**: Medium launch and medium pushback. Enemy is put in a downed state.

Multiple activations (either by yourself or with CPUs/other players) will cause effects to stack or interact with one another. This may result in a very high vertical launch or knockdown. Make sure to be ready to attack downed enemies when specific characters use overlimit. When using Yuri, remember you can chain the OVL activation hit with a free-run attack, picking the enemy up and making follow up attacks easier.

### Other information

**Down Hit Mechanics**

There are different types of down states, and each has different characteristics:

Ground down

- Normal downed state.
- The enemy will start an animation to get up after a certain period. During the initial frames of this animation (even before the enemy starts to get up) the enemy can be hit by most attacks.
- OTG attacks (and specific attacks that affect downed enemies) can hit through most of the ground down state, and will instantly put the staggered enemy back on its feet.
- If you hit the enemy with an attack that launches upward, it will transition to the "Aerial Down" state.
- Any other attack which does not launch will stagger and the enemy will drop to the "Ground down" state again.

Aerial down

- Most attacks will hit without needing specific timing like ground down. They will also juggle a slight bit.
- Once down to the ground, the enemy will do a slight bounce and transition to the "Ground down" state.

**Ground Hit Limit**

While attacking downed enemies, there is a hard limit on 9 hits that you can do before they ignore any further attacks that would cause a ground down. You can still hit them with moves that cause an aerial down.

This counter is only reduced when hitting an enemy that is in the ground down state. Both Aerial down hits and Ground down hits will count to this limit.


Definitions:

**OTG**: OTG, or off-the-ground attacks, are flags that certain attacks (or part of attacks) have that make the enemy transition from a downed to a standing state when hit. They can be useful to continue the normal combo progression after a knockdown arte or spell.

**Spell Casting Time Mechanics**

Spells need casting time before they can come out. There are ways however, to reduce this time. They are:

Accessories:

- Mystic Mark: 15% reduction.
- Mystic Symbol: 25% reduction.
- Shizel's Necklace: 50% reduction (Rita only).

Skills:

- Speed Spell: 30% reduction.
- Light Magic: 40% reduction.
- Rhythm: Up to 50%.

Chains:

*:{'todo' : true} - 8% per arte in the chain (persists through manual cancelling).*

All these reduction only affect artes will only work up to certain amount, just like other games in the series.

With Rita, being in the air automatically cancels the special animation of advanced spells. Spell casting is also faster overall by about 18 frames (not counting the time saved by the animation of advanced spells).

## Glitches

In this section, we have a group of glitches and a small description on how to replicate/explain them. In this section, you will not find glitches that are currently useful for combat, this is found on the next segment.

### Out of Bounds and Sequence Breaks

#### :{'todo' : true} Tutorials Skip

If you enter a tutorial battle with a character other than Yuri with the skill "Stand alone", the tutorial will not occur and it will be a normal battle.

#### :{'todo' : true, 'versions' : 'Vanilla'} Raven and Estelle Early

PS. This glitch requires you to progress the Dark Enforcer side quest up until you learn Shining Eagle.

During the part where Raven and Estelle leave the party you can:

- Talk to Flynn in the current Yormgen and go to Mantaic.
- Go to the oasis and talk to the man sitting down by the two children for a scene.
- Rest at Mantaic's inn. Go toward the oasis again for a scene.

Raven and Estelle are now in your party.

### Minor Battle Glitches

#### :{'todo' : true, 'versions' : 'Vanilla'} Hourglass Fatal Strikes

If you hourglass an enemy with the FS symbol active, you can do them any number of times until the Hourglass effect ends.

#### :{'versions' : 'Vanilla'} Infinite Invincibility

Have the Eternal Support skill equipped on Estelle, and then have her cast Force Field over and over. If Eternal Support activates, whoever received the Force Field will become invincible for the rest of the battle.

#### :{'versions' : 'Definitive 1.0 Switch'} Switch Shortcut Glitches

On the switch version, artes come out on stick release, and holding the stick makes your character stuck. You can use this time to change your action to another arte.

You can find more information about it [here](https://t.co/XV4Xg4M0mv).

## Combat Techniques

Here we will discuss various different techniques/glitches that can be used during combat.

### General Techniques

#### :{'media' : 'media/tov/spellCancel.mp4'} Spell Cancel

Instead of using free-run to cancel the recovery of attacks, you can use a spell then instantly cancel it for the same effect. This is usually faster than a MC but harder to perform. A perfect spell cancel will give control back to the user after 15 frames.

#### Pseudo Quick Turn

Without the quick turn skill, there is a small animation when a character changes directions abruptly. This animation can get your character punished, especially when you try to turn and attack just after.

To avoid this, you can start a free-run (while walking away), do a quick 180° (by rotating the left-stick) and let go of free-run. Your character will perform a (slower) quick turn and be ready way earlier than having to wait for the animation.

You can also use the battle arena perimeter to quick turn. While touching it, you can turn around on the same speed as the quick turn skill.

#### :{'todo' : true} Spell Chant Reduction

Character specific: Rita.
Skill Needed: Spell Charge (1,2,3)

When using spells with Rita, you can hold the spell button (or hold the artes button before using R-stick shortcuts) to hold the spell, and press it again as soon as it is ready. This will remove the extra animation that the advanced spells have, making them come out a little faster. This is only needed when grounded.

#### :{'todo' : true, 'versions' : 'Vanilla'} Spells with any character

On the artes screen, select and arte with the cursor and switch characters at the same time as pressing A. The switched character will be able to perform the spell (the screen will return to the original character when pressing A).

#### :{'todo' : true, 'versions' : 'PS3'} Infinite Overlimit

Skills required: Burst hold.

While an enemy boss is in overlimit, if you manage to use a burst arte at the end of your own overlimit and the boss performs an M.A., you will have infinite overlimit after the M.A. ends.

#### Rita's Absorption Mechanics

Skills required: Absorption.

Absorption is a skill that allows Rita to nullify attacks when casting spells. For this to work, you need to cast a spell with the same attribute that the enemy is using against you. You can even hold the spell to make sure your spell release is not interrupted.

One important thing that might be missed is that when using fire elemental spells, such as Eruption, you will be immune to physical attacks. Meteor Storm, while being categorized as a non-elemental spell, still works for physical attacks.

#### Yuri's Combination Skill Stacking

Skills required: Combination 1, 2 and/or 3.

Yuri's combination skill is an offensive skill that increases the damage you deal by following a specific combo. Any level of this skill will provide a damage boost to the last action you actually hit after finishing the pre-defined combo. This can be exploited by purposively missing attacks and stacking the damage boost. All three combinations skills can be stacked for huge amounts of damage.

You can also apply the damage boosts to other attacks, even mid combo. For example, as long as the last hit of the pre-defined combo doesn't connect, you can apply the combination damage boost to other actions such as Fatal Strikes and Burst Artes.

You can see examples of combination stacking [here](https://youtu.be/uTMcL1KJD74?t=131) and [here](https://youtu.be/A10Zua38cv0?t=232).

#### :{'todo' : true, 'media' : 'media/tov/atgc.mp4'} Air to Ground Cancel

Do an aerial-enabled arte close to the ground for possible effects. These include: lingering hit-boxes, visual effects or cancelled animations.
For example, most aerial-enabled altered artes can produce the shine animation without the actual attack coming out.
The window for activation is around 6 frames before landing, different frames possibly producing different effects.

#### :{'media' : 'media/tov/tauntCancel.mp4'} Taunt Cancel

Skills needed: Bark.

Repede has a skill that makes his taunt have a chance (~33%) to cancel everything on the screen. Use this to cancel burst artes, fatal strikes and everything else.

If using it after an arcane or altered arte in overlimit, the user can also do a burst arte just after the cancel. You can find more information [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAFJ4Ho-Qts).

There are a few ways to use this consistently.

The first is to have a second controller, and do the taunt with Repede yourself. Pausing and un-pausing can also improve consistency when using two controllers alone (and does not make the camera move around).

The second is to have Raven in the party. During the action you want to cancel, pause and change to Raven. While in the menu, use your personal strategy (character specific down strategy), pause and un-pause, change back to your character and change to the strategy back to the one you want to use. This is more consistent than using Repede to taunt yourself, since you would have wait a couple of frames to make sure the taunt will come out.

If you want to avoid the camera change caused by Raven's personal strategy, you can use a similar method with two controllers: set your player 1 as Raven and have hit sit on auto-mode. Use player 2 to attack until you want the cancel to happen, where you would pause, set your character's personal strategy, and un-pause. In the menu, the strategy would show as player's 2 character (the one that paused the game), but Raven's is the one that will be activated. For better control, unequip Taunt from Repede and only equip a taunt weapon once you enter the menu. You can then unequip the weapon once you don't need the cancel properties of the taunt.

#### :{'media' : 'media/tov/fakeGuardArte.mp4'} Empty Guard Artes

Skills needed: Guard artes.

In semi-auto mode, guarding then doing a base arte from a distance makes you run to the enemy, however the invincibility effect happens as soon as you begin to run. Cancelling the running animation in a guard makes you use the invincibility without using an arte.

#### Delayed Healing Fight Skip

By using delayed healing abilities, such as healing moves that need to hit (Raven, Karol) and delaying spells (Estelle's Resurrection and Regenerate), you can win fights as long as the healing move affects one of your characters after your party is wiped out.

You can see examples of this in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZizRvRh3Oo&t=44s) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWfSeT08yUs).

#### :{'todo' : true} Reviving FS

Skills needed: FS Bonus.

By using a Fatal Strike and getting your HP to 0 while doing it, you can resurrect yourself if you have the FS Bonus skill equipped.

Timing is strict.

You can see an example of this in action [here](https://t.co/GTNywLHEO8).

### Fatal Strike Techniques

Fatal Strike is a mechanic in Tales of Vesperia that is learned during a tutorial fight on *:!Caer Bocram*. It usually is used to defeat normal enemies in a single hit, which is done by reducing a special gauge that is present in every enemy (up, which is blue; down, which is red; and right, which is green). For bosses, fatal strikes deal a large amount of damage. To decrease the gauge, you can use artes or normal attacks that correspond to specific color or direction.

FS also gives bonus during and at the end of battle. At the end of battle you can be awarded with extra EXP, LP or Drop Rate. This bonus will be higher depending on your FS chain, which is the amount of FS glyphs that appeared before you performed the FS. This is limited to the same combo. For example, a chain of 10 is enough for any drop to have 100% chance of happening. The specific award that you get depends on the type of enemy that you performed the FS chain against.

The FS bonuses during battle depend on the chain before you activated them. A Green FS will recover TP. A Red FS will buff defensive stats. A Blue FS will buff offensive stats. This bonus will increase by 1% for each FS chain you do (thus, the bonus will be the same as the current chain number you have on screen). This is limited to 25% on the Definitive or PS3 version. On the Vanilla Xbox version this number is unlimited. One important thing to note, however, is that this buff is depend on the last glyph your target had, which may not be the glyph you started the FS activation on.

On the Definitive version, FS glyphs stay on screen for less time than both the Vanilla version and the PS3 version. This effect happens on all platforms and with different frame rates.

#### False Strikes

It is possible to make Fatal Strikes not instantly kill enemies by pressing the Fatal Strike button one frame before the Fatal Strike late fail state and one frame after it. This will cause both the FS success and fail animation to play at the same time. Doing this on a boss makes so that the FS gauge does not recover and that no bonuses for FS are applied (for the current FS); the same effects also happen on normal enemies.

To make it easier to perform, it is possible to use pause buffering to get the correct frames more consistently. Once you get the frame, simply un-pause and then quickly press FS + menu again. Repeat the same steps to hit the second frame needed for the technique. While this setup is still inconsistent, it makes it way easier to perform. Using specific artes to trigger the FS glyph can also improve consistency.

This is possible in all versions in the game and with various frame rates (60, 75, uncapped...).

More information [here](https://muragiri.hatenadiary.org/entry/20100322/p1).

#### Target Change Fatal Strike

There is another way to not instantly kill enemies when using a Fatal Strike. To perform this trick, simply activate a Fatal Strike and pressing the menu button at the same time; when on the menu, change your character to auto-mode and use an arte on another monster on the field that wasn't the one you performed the FS on. Your character will change targets but still perform the FS (which will not kill the enemy). If the FS hits the enemy that had the FS glyph, it will still not kill it (as long as your character was not aiming for them).

You can use other party members to setup a FS on a monster you are not attacking, making it possible for you to use the FS on a monster that still has their FS gauge full or using Fatal Strikes mid combo.

Keep in mind that an arte will be buffered if you do this. You also need to change the character you were controlling back to semi-auto or manual.

#### Fatal Strike Cancel

While the enemy has a Fatal Strike glyph up, you can press an action and the FS button together to cancel your _current action_ (if possible) and instantly start the action you pressed (the _cancel action_). This can only be performed when you are able to perform a successful FS in the first place, so keep in mind that some actions disable your FS use momentarily. In most cases, FS use is enabled after the last hit of most artes (but earlier than it can be canceled normally).

*:{'media' : 'media/tov/fscancel.mp4', 'forcedvideo' : true}*

_Cancel actions_ can be artes or normal attacks.

There a few important notes about this cancel:

- Your arte chain rules persist when using FS Cancelling, thus, you cannot use an arte that wouldn't be able to be chained without the cancel in place. This means that, for most characters, you cannot FS cancel an Arcane arte when not in OVL.
- If your character is in the air, you are only able to use air-enabled artes when doing the cancel.
- Just like the Taunt Cancel, your momentum will persist depending on your previous action, as you can see [here](https://www.twitch.tv/sailorvick/clip/HonestBetterSaladSMOrc).

### Manual Cancel

*:{'media' : 'media/tov/manualCancel.mp4', 'forcedvideo' : true} Also called Free-Run Cancel (FRC), Manual Cancel is a basic battle technique where you can cancel the recovery frames of attacks. This technique can be used in all characters in the PS3 version (while in manual mode), while in the vanilla only Repede can use it with a skill.*

For the Repede skill, it enables the user to use Manual Cancel in any direction (360 degrees) and also use it in semi-auto mode.

#### Manual Cancel Basics

After an arte you can free run to the direction of the arte to start a free-run as soon as you can cancel the arte. This is useful to avoid punish for attacks that are negative on hit, such as Azure Edge.

You can then cancel the free-run into a guard/magic guard to quickly go back to neutral and be able to do another arte or normal as fast as possible.

Below are variations of the MC that can be useful in different scenarios. Keep in mind that if you guard while moving it takes 24 frames for your character to go back to neutral. Magic guard only takes 14 frames to recover when moving. Both take 14 frames to recover when standing still (or below a certain x velocity).

#### Empty MC

Quickly tap Free-run then completely stop, your character will reach the neutral state on its own. This is slower than a normal Manual Cancel but does not require you to press guard.

#### :{'media' : 'media/tov/mgfrc.mp4'} Magic Guard MC

Quickly press Free-run and do a reverse fireball motion (forward → forward-down → down) for the magic guard to come out. You can also go straight from forward to down if possible (strict input). After that release guard and wait for the neutral state

#### Corner MC

Quickly press Free-run slightly towards the arena perimeter or towards a big enemy. Your character should not have any horizontal movement if successful. After that guard and wait for the neutral state.

Sometimes, there is a frame advantage on delaying the guard slightly in order to come closer to the enemy, consequently making you horizontal momentum 0 and making your guard recover faster. The slowest setup is quickly tapping free-run as soon as you can cancel the current arte. This will result in a cancel of ~22 frames, slightly faster than the normal MC.

#### Guard Cancel MC

Skills needed: Guard artes, Ability Plus.

Do the normal MC inputs but, as soon as you start the guard animation, input a base arte. The base arte will cancel the guard. This will not reset your arte progression, it will just cancel out of guard faster, thus its uses are limited.

#### :{'todo' : true} MC Frame data

Heres some frame data about Manual Cancel and its variations (keep in mind that a magic guard is about 10 frames faster than a normal guard):

From slowest to fastest (FR = Free run animation), considering perfect inputs:

- Empty MC: 25+ frames until next action. (25+)
- MC: 1(FR) + 24 frames until next action. (25)
- Magic Guard MC = 2(FR) + 14 frames until next action. (16)
- Corner MC = 1(FR) + 14 frames until next action. (15)
- Guard Cancel = 1(FR) + 6 frames until base arte starts. (7)

### Boss Behavior Manipulation

Bosses do not function like normal enemies. Without manipulating them, they can apparently drop out of your combo and punish you, even while they the stagger values would not allow them too. To combat that, here are some techniques that can help you combo bosses:

#### :{'todo' : true} Recovery Attack baiting

Letting the enemy do their chain before you start your combo (punishing the enemy at the end of their combo) or punishing their recovery attacks in a safely manner (e.g. using knockdowns mid-combo and expecting them to use an arte) can make so that you can perform your combos "mostly" uninterrupted.

The number of attacks a boss can use is unique to each boss (though they are usually the same as the player).

For example, punishing a normal -> base -> arcane chain as you start your combo will more than likely work for most bosses. Punishing 2-3 of their recovery attacks during the combo will also work the same way.

#### Stun lock

Stunning an enemy during a combo will make so that they will not be able to do a recovery attack during it. If you did not bait recovery attacks previously (in the same combo), keep in mind that the enemy may still do them if knocked down.

#### Boss Documented Behavior

There are certain behavior that are unique to bosses also:

- Recover Breakout: Knocking a boss down may make the boss do a flip (recover) and stay on the standing state, instead of being knocked down.
- Stat Breakout: Due to defenses, a boss may be able to solid stance through your attacks (even after you break their guard). This effect is not that common, and only certain bosses may have enough defenses to solid stance through your initial attacks.
- Recovery Attack Breakout: If able, the boss can do a recovery attack mid-combo. This also resets the staggered status (but does not drop your current combo chain), so a stat breakout may occur if you hit them in frames that they are not vulnerable.

Therefore, to properly combo a boss without ever being punished you need: good offensive stats to not trigger solid stance during the combo, baiting recovery attacks or an arte chain and, finally, a stun lock.

More information can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKdSnZqTX5w).

### Semi-auto Cancel

Also sometimes called Stick Cancel, the Semi-auto cancel (SAC) is a technique that abuses the free-run animation that happens when you use semi-auto, and the buffered actions of auto mode.

*:{'media' : 'media/tov/sac.mp4', 'forcedvideo' : true} Using SAC's cancels any sort of casting bonuses and resets actions that can only be done 1 per chain (such as Judith's dash and guard artes).*

SAC can be set-up mid combo, and it does not require neutral stance/guard to be in effect.

#### Semi-auto Cancel Basics

While in any action (free-run, guard, jump or arte) go to the menu and buffer an arte by selecting it while in auto mode (in the character that you're controlling), then, while in battle, change back to semi-auto mode (manual can be used in limited scenarios). The arte you selected in auto mode is now buffered and the game will make you run to the enemy to use it every time it is possible.

While this arte is buffered, you can, while in a combo, perform another arte that requires you to run to the target (due to the semi-auto mechanics) to instantly cancel you to neutral and start the buffered arte (thus starting another semi-auto run). If you perform another action before the buffered action is completed, you successfully used a Semi-auto cancel to reset your arte progression and use an action when your not supposed to.

For example, with Yuri:

Set auto buffered arte as Draconian Slash.

Free-run to the enemy and do Azure Storm. Cancel Azure Storm into Severing Fang. This will start the free-run animation, and instantly cancel it into another free-run animation that will perform Draconian Slash if you let it. Instead of that, do another Azure Storm just after inputting Severing Fang. This will cause Yuri to do Azure Storm followed to Azure Storm, something that is not possibly normally.

For all further examples, artes set on auto (in this example Draconian Slash) are called **buffered artes**. Artes used for the cancel are called (in this example Severing Fang) are called **cancel artes**.

For better effect, both buffered artes and cancel artes need to be artes that require your character to be very close to the enemy to perform. The enemy dimensions can also be important, since there are occasions where the character will be stuck in the free-run animation without the arte coming out (usually on the enemy's tails or limbs).

Keep in mind that you can also cancel to normals instead of artes.

#### Spell SAC

If you use a spell as the cancel arte, the SAC instantly cancels it, allowing you to chain any arte as fast as possible with no distance restriction. This helps in occasions where the cancel arte can come one by mistake due to the distance between you and the enemy.

This variation can also be done on manual monde.

In semi-auto, if you mash spells while moving they will be instantly cancelled into movement again, resulting in some interesting visual effects.

#### Walk SAC

If you use the left-stick as the main form of movement, and hold the walk angle (slight movement on the L-Stick), any movement due to the semi-auto run will be a walk instead, increasing the consistency of the technique.

You can also hold the walk angle away from the enemy, causing the user to do a quick turn around, giving you even more time to perform the cancel.

Finally, you can always cancel the semi-auto run into a free-run, preventing any sort of arte to come out and easily chaining into your own arte or free-run attack.

#### SAC consume

An even easier way to perform SAC's is to set the buffered arte as the arte you want to use instead. This way, the cancel arte is the only one which requires the distance to be strict. The objective is to do your combo, use your cancel arte and then do nothing and wait for the buffered arte to come out.

If you want, you can then pause and set up a new buffered arte to use another SAC consume, mid-combo.

#### :{'media' : 'media/tov/pushGuardChain.mp4'} Push Guard Chain

Skills needed: Guard artes, Critical Guard.

If your cancel arte is a base arte, you can use it to cancel push guards (Critical Guard skill), making it possible to chain them until your close enough to perform your buffered arte. This can be a very fast way to move forward, especially with characters like Raven.

#### Empty Guard Arte Chaining

Skills needed: Guard artes, Magic Guard (optional).

With semi-auto cancel, as it removes guard delay, you can chain empty guard artes in place instead of needing to run a bit. The invincibility effect stacks, so chaining a lot of empty guard artes can make you invincible for tens of seconds (with only about 2 seconds of mashing). Using a magic guard (with the cancel base arte set as down) can make you perform the chains even faster, making you invincible for multiple seconds and even minutes.
