### Boss AI Manipulation

Multiple bosses in Tales of Destiny can be manipulated to make fights easier, such as ignoring mechanics or skipping phases. Bait resets can be used to easily punish bosses, and spell locking can trivialize some fights.

Certain fights, however, have unique ways in that they can be manipulated.

!!Ilene!! has a unique glitch where, if she blocks a BC, she will stay in that state until you pause the game, try to change targets, or hit her. This effect changes in the different versions of the game. You can use this time to heal up, cast spells, or even safely set up the spell lock technique.

The !!Rembrandt!! fight has multiple ways in which you can manipulate it. The fight has certain HP thresholds where he changes from a ground form to an air form. All of these can be canceled by using a BC. You can also use a BC just after the change form animation is playing: if you do it while he is going to the air, he will be stuck in the air on the ground form; if you do it while he is going to the ground, he will be stuck in the ground on the air form.
