#### :{'media' : 'media/todps2/caveQueen.mp4', 'forcedmedia' : false, 'caption' : 'Test Caption.'} Skip Cave Queen

By walking on the side of a ledge on the screen that the Cave Queen boss battle starts, you can skip it and get to Moreau town faster. You can buy some items there and talk to NPCs, but you still need to beat Cave Queen to continue the story. More information [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzvcOjRu81o).
