### [[Media:media/todps2/leonJump.mp4]] Swallow Talon Glitch

Swallow Talon has an interesting effect when mid-way canceling with a jump. Normally, the user will jump forward slightly. However, if you jump just before the second part of the attack, you will get a large amount of momentum backward. If you do a normal attack instead, you will get some vertical height during your attack.

### Attack Cancel Glitched Artes

Using [[{TODPS2}attack cancel|attack canceled]] artes after a normal attack or another attack canceled arte can have some glitchy effects. For example, Dragon Swarmn and Phantom Edge will have half as much range. Only some artes can cause this effect. Artes that are not affected by this glitch will not cancel it, and the effect will be stored in memory until it is consumed. For example, you can do a normal attack followed by an attack canceled arte that doesn't consume the effect (ex: Glimmer Dragon) to store it for a future combo.
